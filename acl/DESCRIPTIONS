Which Files to Take:
   It is recommended that you download all patches from this directory
 that apply to the platform on which you use Allegro CL. For each file
 downloaded from this directory, replace each file with the  same name
 in your ACL distribution with the downloaded file.  For the ACL
 shared-library, you should also look for any other copies of the file
 on your system and replace them with the new version. Once all files
 are replaced, your ACL distribution will be updated.

  If you have any questions about any patch or the patch loading
procedure, please contact Franz Inc. by email to "bugs@franz.com";
or by phone to (510) 452-2000 (during Pacific Time work hours); or by
fax to (510) 452-0182.
