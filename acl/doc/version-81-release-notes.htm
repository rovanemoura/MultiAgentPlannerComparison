This document is a copy of the version 8.1 release notes taken at a
time prior to the release of version 8.2. Subsequent changes are not
tracked. The actual current 8.1 release notes are available
at <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/doc/release-notes.htm">www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/doc/release-notes.htm</a>. This
document is included in the 8.2 documentation to allow users who
happen not to have access to the internet to see changes from 8.0 to
8.1 which may affect them but which are not otherwise discussed in the
8.2 documentation.
</p>
<p id="6">
Many
sections are divided into non-backward-compatible changes (that
produce different behavior in release 8.1
compared to release 8.0) and changes
unrelated to backward-compatibility. Note that a bug fix is <i>not</i>
considered a backward-incompatible change even if it does result in
changed behavior because the previous behavior was erroneous.
</p>


<p id="7">
This document describes the changes, major and minor, from 8.0 to
8.1. Please look particularly at these sections:
</p>

<ul>

<li id="8">
<a href="#acl-new">Section 6.1 New features in the base Lisp</a>: this section describes new
features.
</li>
<li id="9">
<a href="#acl-non-back-2">Section 6.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in the base Lisp</a>: this very important
section describes changes to Allegro CL which are <b>not</b> backward
compatible. You may have to modify your source code in light of these
changes.
</li>
<li id="10">

<a href="#cg-non-back-2">Section 8.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in Common Graphics</a>: [Common Graphics is not
available on all platforms] this section describes changes to Common
Graphics which are <b>not</b> backward compatible. You may have to

</li>

<li id="11">
<a href="#post81-info-1">Section 2.0 Information on changes and new stuff since the 8.1 release</a>: this section describes
material added after the initial Allegro CL 8.1 release, along with
other post-8.1 changes. (This section has not been updated since May, 2009. See <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/doc/release-notes.htm">www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/doc/release-notes.htm</a> for the most current actual 8.1 release notes.)

</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="13"><a name="post81-info-1">2.0 Information on changes and new stuff since the 8.1 release</a></h2>

<p id="14">
There are regular documentation updates. The updated documentation is
available on our website (<a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/">www.franz.com/support/documentation/</a>,
where you will find links to the 8.1 documentation (and links to the
documentation for earlier releases) and links that allow you to
download the updated docs.
</p>
<p id="15">
Other post-8.1 releases changes include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="16">
<b>New plot widget for drawing X/Y graphs (such as scatter
graphs)</b>. An analog of the existing <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a>, the new <b><a href="classes/cg/plot-widget.htm"><code>plot-widget</code></a></b> allows drawing X/Y plots of
various types. The <a href="classes/cg/plot-widget.htm"><code>plot-widget</code></a> page has several examples. There are
new functions and many <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> operators and classes have been
modified to encompass the new plot functionality. (The biggest change
is where methods are defined, with methods previously defined on a
class now being inherited from a superclass.)
Existing <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> code
should work without change. The plot-widget was added in an update
released in the Fall of 2008 but the documentation was only added in
early 2009.
</li>
<li id="17">
<b>New interface to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) API</b>: this
allows accessing EC2 directly from Lisp. See the new
document <a href="ec2.htm">ec2.htm</a> for more information. An update
released in mid-December, 2008, contains the new software.
</li>
<li id="18">
<b>Enhancements to IDE projects allows easier handling of
subprojects</b>: various enhancements to projects (see
<a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/doc/cgide.htm#project-update-1">Notes
on a project enhancements</a> in the 8.1 <b>cgide.htm</b> (link
requires internet access). These modification were provided in an
update released in the late Fall, 2008.
</li>
<li id="19">
<b>Enhancements to the mail functions send-smtp, send-smtp-auth and
send-letter to support SSL and STARTTLS</b>. The mail
functions <a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp.htm"><b>send-smtp</b></a>, <a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp-auth.htm"><b>send-smtp-auth</b></a>,
and <a href="operators/post-office/send-letter.htm"><b>send-letter</b></a>
have all been been enhanced to allow for ssl connections and STARTTLS
negotiation ('TLS' stands for Transport Layer Security and is another
name for SSL.) The enhancement is implemented by allowing information
to be included in the value of
the <i>mail-server</i>. See the (linked) function
descriptions for details. The update with this new functionality was
released in Spetember, 2008.
</li>
<li id="20">
<b>Changes to SSL interface allows using more methods and using
ciphers</b>. The <b><i>methods</i></b> keyword argument
to <a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a> and
<a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>
now accepts more options allowing more control over which SSL protocol
is used. A new ciphers keyword argument allows using a cipher. This
change was made in an update released in mid-2008.
</li>
<li id="21">
<b>Enhanced update.exe on Windows now also downloads
updates</b>. <b>update.exe</b> is the program on Windows that rebuilds
images when you have obtained updates using <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> (or
the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/download-dialog.htm">Download
Patches</a> dialog). <b>update.exe</b> has been enhanced to
accept arguments: <b>-u</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-P</b>. When <b>-u</b>
is passed, updates will be downloaded and new images built if
necessary. <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> specify how
<a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> (which
is called when <b>-u</b> is specified) will deal with proxies. See the
description of <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> for details. For the
Allegro CL 8.1 Express edition on Windows only, there is a
new <b>Rebuild images (download new updates first)</b> menu item on
the <b>Start | Programs | Allegro CL 8.1 Express</b> menu which calls
<b>update.exe</b> with the <b>-u</b> option.
</li>
<li id="22">
<b>New version of Allegro CL Express gets license file
automatically</b>. The installation process for Windows has
automatically obtained the license file for some time. Now, new
procedures for installation on the various UNIX-like platform
including Mac OS X do so as well. There is also a small change to the
Windows procedure, with the name of the self-extracting executable
changed to <b>acl81_express.exe</b>. The Express Edition is fully
described on the Franz Inc. web site
(<a href="http://www.franz.com">www.franz.com</a>, click on
the <b>Download</b> button to see information about Express software).
</li>
<li id="23">

<b>New unix-shared-library examples and documentation</b>. The
description of how to make a Lisp application a shared library on
Unix-style platforms is now applicable to all such
platforms. See <a href="unix-shared-library.htm">unix-shared-library.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="24">

<b>New util-string module and util.string:string+ function</b>. The
module was released in an update in early February, 2008. The module
is designed to provide string utility functions that are more
efficient or more convenient that Common Lisp string functions. The
first new function is <a href="string-utilities.htm#string+-op-bookmarkxx"><b>string+</b></a>. It acts like
<code>(concatenate 'string ...)</code> but accepts any objects
as arguments (stringifying them with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-to.htm"><b>princ-to-string</b></a>) and like
<code>(format nil "..."  ...)</code> but is faster, particularly
for short strings and certain common object types, and easier to
use. See <a href="string-utilities.htm">string-utilities.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="25">

<b>New operating system interface function excl.osi:mkdtemp creates a
uniquely named temporary directory</b>. This new function does not
work on Windows, Solaris, or HP-UX. <a href="os-interface.htm#mkdtemp-op-bookmarkxx"><b>excl.osi:mkdtemp</b></a> takes a string
ending in six X's (like "/tmp/mydirXXXXXX") as its argument. It
replaces the six X's with characters that result in a new directory
name, creates the directory, and returns the new name (a string). This
function was added in an update released in mid January.

</li>
<li id="26">
<b>New compact keyword argument to
net.mail:extract-email-addresses</b>.
<a href="imap.htm#extract-email-addresses-op-bookmarkxx"><b>extract-email-addresses</b></a> now accepts
a <i>compact</i> keyword argument, which, when specified
true, causes the results to be returned as a list
of <code>user@domain</code> strings.
</li>
<li id="27">

<b>excl.shell:rm has a new no-execute keyword argument</b>. Like the
<i>no-execute</i> argument to other shell functions,
when specified true, information about what would be done is printed
but no further action is taken. See <a href="shell-module.htm#rm-op-bookmarkxx"><b>rm</b></a> and
<a href="shell-module.htm">shell-module.htm</a>. This change is made in a patch
released in early October, 2007.

</li>
<li id="28">

<b>defun-foreign-callable now accepts a returning
declaration</b>. <a href="operators/ff/defun-foreign-callable.htm"><b>defun-foreign-callable</b></a> accepts "declarations"
which provide information about the foreign-callable Lisp function. A
<code>:returning</code> declaration is now accepted. Its value
can be a foreign type. The <code>:returning</code> declaration
replaces the <i>convert-to-c-types</i> argument in
<a href="operators/ff/register-foreign-callable.htm"><b>register-foreign-callable</b></a> when
it is used. Note this feature was included as a patch in release 8.0
but not documented. Nor was the documentation included in the 8.1
documentation as released. No patch is necessary for 8.1.

</li>
<li id="29">

<b>md5-file has a return keyword argument</b>. The documentation
for <a href="operators/excl/md5-file.htm"><b>md5-file</b></a> did not
describe it but has been corrected.

</li>
</ul>

<hr><hr><h2 id="30"><a name="fasl-incompat-1">3.0 Fasl files are not-compatible between versions and operating systems</a></h2>



<hr><h2 id="31"><a name="version-fasl-incompat-2">3.1 All pre-8.1 Lisp compiled files must be recompiled (old fasl files will not load)</a></h2>

<p id="32">
<i>fasl</i> files (compiled Lisp files) created by
releases of Allegro CL prior to 8.1 
will not load into Allegro CL 8.1. All such files must be recreated by
compiling the associated Lisp source files. An error will be signaled
if Lisp attempts to load an older, incompatible
<i>fasl</i> file.
</p>
<p id="33">
8.1.beta fasl file will load into 8.1 final. There is no need to
recompile 8.1.beta compiled files.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="34"><a name="os-fasl-incompat-2">3.2 Fasl files may be incompatible in different Lisps on same hardware</a></h2>

<h3 id="35">
Fasl files created on Windows x86 cannot be loaded into Linux or
FreeBSD x86 Lisps
</h3>

<p id="36">
The Windows and UNIX operating systems are too different. However,
FASL files (for the same Lisp version) can generally be shared between
different UNIX operating systems on the same hardware. The general
principles are as follows. Note that incompatibility may creep in for
reasons outside our control. If fasl files are incompatible, recompile
on the target machine.
</p>
<h3 id="37">
Fasl files will usually be compatible between platforms when:
</h3>
<ul>
<li id="38">
the architecture (hardware) is the same
</li>
<li id="39">
the calling convention is the same (that is, the method of calling
functions and the registers they use for arguments are the same)
</li>
<li id="40">
the method for generating signals can be made compatible (this cannot
be done for Windows and UNIX, so they are incompatible for this
reason)
</li>
</ul>
<p id="41">
It is up to the user to ensure that there are no os-specific
dependencies, or that features (i.e. #+/#- ) did not cause
essential code to be excluded or extraneous code introduced
that would cause a problem on the crossed architecture.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="42"><a name="install-1">4.0 Release Notes for installation</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="43">

<b>Except for Mac OS X, version 8.1 uses the 8.0 installation
procedure</b>: installation is described in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>. Mac OS X installation is
described in the section <a href="installation.htm#macosx-install-1">Installation on Mac OS X</a> in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="44">
<b>The distribution includes 8 bit and 16 bit character images</b>
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). Allegro CL
has images that support 8 bit characters only, or 16 bit
characters only. It is our expectation that most users will use the 16
bit images. Executables supplied with the distribution either have or
do not have `8' in the name. Those with 8 in the name (mlisp8 and
alisp8, e.g.) support 8 bit characters. Those without a number in the
name support 16 bit characters. Image (dxl) files also come in 8 and
16 varieties. Again, 8 in the name means 8 bit character
support. Character support for images and executables must
match. Trying to start an executable with the wrong type of image
fails.
</li>

<li id="45">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro Composer images in the distribution</b> 
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To
create an Allegro Composer image, start Allegro CL and load
<em>buildcomposer.cl</em>. That will produce <em>composer</em> and
<em>composer.dxl</em>, or <em>composer8</em> and
<em>composer8.dxl</em>. Allegro Composer is available on Unix only.
</li>

<li id="46">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro CLIM images in the distribution</b> (this
information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To create a CLIM
image, start Allegro CL and load <em>buildclim.cl</em>. That will
produce <em>clim</em> and <em>clim.dxl</em>, or <em>clim8</em> and
<em>clim8.dxl</em>.

Franz Inc. cannot maintain the same release schedule as the many
operating system providers on the many platforms we support.  Usually
Allegro Common Lisp and all of its component parts will work on new
Operating System versions that become available after release. But
sometimes Allegro CL patches or operating-system patches, or
installation tweaks, will be required before Lisp will run on an
updated system.
</p>
<p id="70">
Franz Inc. usually finds out about any such issues soon after new
operating system releases appear and devises any necessary patches or
compatibility procedures.  We maintain current information about
operating system versions on this web page: <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/osinfo.lhtml">http://www.franz.com/support/osinfo.lhtml</a>. We strongly advise you to check that page before
updating your operating system. If we know that the new operating
system is compatible, or is compatible with certain patches, you will
find the information there. Similarly if it is known to be
incompatible. If the new operating system is not yet listed it may be
that it has not yet been tested.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="71"><a name="sparc-patch-2">5.1 OS patch needed for Solaris 2.8 on Sparcs</a></h2>

<p id="72">
A problem with Solaris 2.8 where calls to <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a> can cause Lisp to hang is
fixed by operating system patch 108993-18 (which supersedes the
earlier patch 108827-36 for this problem). On Solaris 8, it can
also be fixed by adding <b>/usr/lib/lwp</b> to the front of your
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable. No fix is
necessary for Solaris 2.9.
</p>
<p id="73">
The patch can be obtained from this Sun website: <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-49843-1">http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-49843-1</a>.

However, that only solves the problem for Allegro CL processes that
are started from within that shell. You can also change the default

<p id="94">
Increasing the default maximum stack size on HPUX 11 requires
modifying kernel configuration parameters, then rebuilding the kernel.
This process should be done by the systems administrator.
</p>
<p id="95">
The file <i>/stand/system</i> is the kernel
configuration file.  The <code>maxssiz</code> and
<code>maxssiz_64bit</code> tunable parameters need to be
increased to at least 32MB each. If you don't have any references to
<code>maxssiz</code> or <code>maxssiz_64bit</code> in your
<i>/stand/system</i> file, then you can simply add these
lines to the bottom of the file:
</p>
<pre id="96">
maxssiz         (32*1024*1024)
maxssiz_64bit   (32*1024*1024)
</pre>

<p id="97">
Otherwise, you'll need to modify the existing parameters so that they
express a value &gt;= 32MB.  
</p>
<p id="98">
After modifying <i>/stand/system</i>, the kernel needs
to be rebuilt using the following command:
</p>
<pre id="99">
<b>/usr/sbin/config -u /stand/system</b>
</pre>

<p id="100">
The system will have to be rebooted for the changes to take effect.

<p id="102">
Allegro CL 8.1 is only supported on Mac OS X version 10.4 or later.
It is not supported on versions 10.3 or
earlier.
</p>


<p id="103">
The Runtime Analyzer (see <a href="runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>)

shared library suitable for loading into Allegro CL. We have
determined that the <code>-flat_namespace</code> to the
<b>ld</b> used to create the shared library is necessary, as shown in
the linked section.
</p>




<hr><h2 id="106"><a name="aix-2">5.5 AIX notes</a></h2>

<p id="107">
In order for Allegro CL 8.1 to run on AIX the following filesets must
be installed:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="108">

<b>bos.perf.perfstat</b>

</li>
<li id="109">

<b>bos.perf.libperfstat</b>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="110">
These filesets should be available on the AIX installation media.
</p>
<p id="111">
Without these filesets, Lisp will likely fail on startup. The exact
nature of the failure depends of the specific <b>dlopen()</b>
implementation. A typical failure message looks like:

<p id="119">
The features described in
<a href="#acl-added-in-80">Section 6.1.1 Features added to Allegro CL 8.0 after the initial release of Allegro CL 8.0</a> were released

<p id="121">
Various additions to Allegro CL 8.0 were added after the original
release of Allegro CL 8.0. We list them here. All are part of release
8.1.
</p>


<ol>
<li id="122">

<b>New features in SSL socket support</b>. Allegro CL has for some
time supported SSL (Secure Socket Layer) sockets. See the section
<a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>. This facility is
enhanced to support processing of certificates. The
argument lists to <a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a> and <a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a> have
been augmented to support the new feature. New methods, <a href="operators/socket/get-ssl-peer-certificate.htm"><b>get-ssl-peer-certificate</b></a>,
<a href="operators/socket/get-ssl-verify-result.htm"><b>get-ssl-verify-result</b></a>,
and <a href="operators/socket/ssl-do-handshake.htm"><b>ssl-do-handshake</b></a>
have been added. <a href="operators/socket/get-ssl-peer-certificate.htm"><b>get-ssl-peer-certificate</b></a> allows
accessing and working with X.509 certificates. A new <a href="classes/socket/x509-certificate.htm"><code>x509-certificate</code></a> class
defines objects corresponding to X.509 certificates.

</li>
<li id="123">

<b>TCP MD5 Signature Option support (Linux platforms only)</b>. The
new function <a href="operators/socket/set-tcp-md5-sig.htm"><b>set-tcp-md5-sig</b></a> provides an interface to
the TCP_MD5SIG (RFC2385) socket option.  It sets the key to be used
for TCP connections from an address. <a href="operators/socket/make-socket.htm"><b>make-socket</b></a> has been modified to accept
new keyword arguments <i>tcp-md5-sig-key</i> and
<i>tcp-md5-sig-key-ef</i>.

</li>
<li id="124">

<b>Daylight saving time changes</b>. Allegro CL finds out whether
daylight ssaving time is or is not in effect by asking the operating
system. The variable <a href="variables/excl/s_daylight-saving-time-observed_s.htm"><code>*daylight-saving-time-observed*</code></a> is now
ignored.  (However, some operating systems have not been updated to
reflect the new United States DST schedules which go into effect in
2007 (with DST starting on March 11, 2007). Allegro CL schedules have
been updated. You can use the old system with the updated schedules if
you set the unexported variable
<b><code>excl::*use-us-daylight-saving-time*</code></b> to
true. Then the variable <a href="variables/excl/s_daylight-saving-time-observed_s.htm"><code>*daylight-saving-time-observed*</code></a> will have
effect. But when your OS is updated to have correct DST information,
you should use that.)

</li>
<li id="125">

<b>New rpc update</b>. The changes included adding a
<i>kill</i> argument to <a href="operators/rpc/client-exit.htm"><b>client-exit</b></a>, modifying <a href="operators/rpc/client-exit.htm"><b>client-exit</b></a> to kill a process on a remote
host, and revising symbol handling in remote references. The
documentation was also updated, with significant changes particularly
to the description of <a href="operators/rpc/run-other-client.htm"><b>run-other-client</b></a>. See
<a href="rpc.htm">rpc.htm</a> for information on RPC in Allegro CL.

</li>
<li id="126">

<b>New :anynl value for eol-convention for input-streams</b>. The
function <a href="operators/excl/eol-convention.htm"><b>eol-convention</b></a>
returns and (with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/setfpset.htm"><b>setf</b></a>) allows
setting the End of Line convention used by a stream. You may now set
the value to <b><code>:anynl</code></b>, which will result 
in any standard end of
line convention being read correctly on input (the UNIX convention of
a linefeed, the DOS convention of a carriage-return linefeed, or the
Mac convention of a carriage-return). See the description of <a href="operators/excl/eol-convention.htm"><b>eol-convention</b></a> for details and a
discussion of what is done for output files.

</li>
<li id="127">

<b>Variable net.uri:*strict-parse* allows parsing of some URIs that
are non-compliant</b>. RFC2396 specifies the format for URIs but many
websites do not strictly follow its rules. The variable <a href="variables/uri/s_strict-parse_s.htm"><code>*strict-parse*</code></a> controls how
strictly the parser observes syntax rules and, when <code>nil</code>, allows parsing of many URIs which are actually
non-compliant. See <a href="uri.htm">uri.htm</a> for details of URI
support.

</li>
<li id="128">

<b>New net.mail package and interface for parsing and validating email
addresses</b>. The module now provides two functions in the new
net.mail package: <a href="imap.htm#parse-email-address-op-bookmarkxx"><b>parse-email-address</b></a> and <a href="imap.htm#valid-email-domain-p-op-bookmarkxx"><b>valid-email-domain-p</b></a>. The first (broadly
following <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt">RFC2822</a>)
extracts the username and domain name from an email address while the
second tries to validate domain names (because many things can go
wrong with email, <a href="imap.htm#valid-email-domain-p-op-bookmarkxx"><b>valid-email-domain-p</b></a> is most useful when
it says a domain is invalid). See <a href="imap.htm#net-mail-1">The net.mail interface for parsing and validating
email addresses</a> in <a href="imap.htm">imap.htm</a> for details.

</li>
<li id="129">

<b>excl:with-underlying-simple-vector exported</b>: the macro <a href="operators/excl/with-underlying-simple-vector.htm"><b>excl:with-underlying-simple-vector</b></a>,
which allows access to the underlying data vector associated with an
array, is now exported and documented. (It has existed as an internal
operator for a long time in Allegro CL.)

</li>
<li id="130">

<b>New ISO 8601 date/time module</b>: support for ISO 8601
specifications of dates and times has been added to Allegro CL. See
<a href="date-time.htm">date-time.htm</a> for details. The functions <a href="operators/excl/locale-format-time.htm"><b>locale-format-time</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/locale-print-time.htm"><b>locale-print-time</b></a> have also been
modified to accept date-time objects as well as universal times as
arguments. (The description of <a href="operators/excl/locale-print-time.htm"><b>locale-print-time</b></a> has been updated to reflect
that change and also to revise the <b>field descriptor definitions</b>
(%F, %G, %g, and %P added, %U, %W removed) and the <b>Modified Conversion
Specifications</b> (%OU and %OW removed), the removed
definitions/specs were never in fact supported.)

</li>
<li id="131">

<b>New module provides PAM support on some platforms</b>. The
<b>pam</b> module provides a Lisp wrapper around the PAM API on Linux,
Solaris, and some other unixlike operating systems. PAM (Pluggable
Authentication Modules) is described in <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/FAQ">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/FAQ</a>. See
<a href="miscellaneous.htm#pam-1">PAM support in Allegro
Common Lisp</a> in <a href="miscellaneous.htm">miscellaneous.htm</a> for
details. PAM is not supported on Windows and some UNIX
platforms. <a href="miscellaneous.htm#pam-1">The PAM
documentation</a> lists the platforms where PAM is not
supported.

</li>
<li id="132">

<b>New FAQ replaces old FAQ</b>. We have a new <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/faq/index.lhtml">FAQ (Frequently
Asked Questions) document</a>. It is only available online (so
you will always see the latest version). It is located at <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/faq/index.lhtml">http://www.franz.com/support/faq/</a>. The
version of our FAQ previously included with the documentation in the
<b>doc/faq/</b> directory has been discontinued and removed (all files
now simply contain a link to the new FAQ).

</li>
<li id="133">

<b>New Emacs-Lisp-Interface command fi:insert-arglist (C-c i)</b>: the
<b>fi:insert-arglist</b> command, when invoked after typing
'(&lt;fun&gt; ', inserts the argument list template into the code
being typed. See <a href="eli.htm#arglists-3">Argument
lists</a> in <a href="eli.htm">eli.htm</a> for details.
<p id="134">
Also, a problem with using Gnu Emacs on Windows compiled with Cygwin
has been fixed.
</p>

</li>
<li id="135">

<b>New optimized variants of read-line</b>. Two new functions, <a href="operators/excl/simple-stream-read-line.htm"><b>simple-stream-read-line</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/read-line-into.htm"><b>read-line-into</b></a> were added to provide
optimized variants of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/read-lin.htm"><b>read-line</b></a>, with little or no consing and less
copying of characters (because the target strings are provided in the
function call). <a href="operators/excl/simple-stream-read-line.htm"><b>simple-stream-read-line</b></a> allows (optionally)
specifying a target string but will create a new string if
necessary. <a href="operators/excl/read-line-into.htm"><b>read-line-into</b></a>
always requires a target string and will use it regardless. It is
therefore always more efficient but it does require correct
bookkeeeping to be used correctly. Both are documented on their own
pages. The <a href="operators/excl/read-line-into.htm"><b>read-line-into</b></a>
page has numerous examples.

</li>
<li id="136">

<b>double-sided option for pop-up-printer-job-dialog</b>. A new
option, <a href="operators/cg/d/double-sided.htm"><b>double-sided</b></a>, has been
added for printer support. See <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-printer-job-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-printer-job-dialog</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="137">

<b>Minor IP address handling upgrade</b>. The function <a href="operators/socket/dotted-address-p.htm"><b>dotted-address-p</b></a> returns true if
its argument is a string in dotted IP address form. See <a href="socket.htm#host-naming-2">Host naming</a> in
<a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a> where the dotted form is described with
examples.

</li>
<li id="138">

<b>sys:update-allegro now allows specifying proxy username and
password</b>. There has long been a <i>proxy</i> keyword
argument to <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>, the function that
downloads updates and patches for Allegro CL. This argument allows
downloading when using a proxy. However, sometimes the proxy also
needs a username and password. A new keyword argument,
<i>proxy-basic-authorization</i>, allows these to be
specified as well. See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="139">

<b>ntservice facility provided</b>: you can make your application a
service on Windows. See <a href="delivery.htm#ntservice-app-1">Turning your application into a Windows
Service</a> in <a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a>. There is an
example (after the update is complete) in <b>examples/ntservice/</b>.

</li>
<li id="140">

<b>jLinker revisions</b>. There are changes in
<a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-listen.htm"><b>jlinker-listen</b></a>
(new :abort value for the <i>stop</i> argument); <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> (new

(documentation clarification); <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-slot.htm"><b>jlinker-slot</b></a> (new value for the
<i>key</i> argument); and a new variable <a href="variables/jlinker/s_jlinker-deprecated-warnings_s.htm"><code>*jlinker-deprecated-warnings*</code></a>. (Also
minor changes in <a href="operators/jlinker/jarray-set.htm"><b>jarray-set</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jdo-call.htm"><b>jdo-call</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jmake-new.htm"><b>jmake-new</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jcons.htm"><b>jcons</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jmeth.htm"><b>jmeth</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jget-cons.htm"><b>jget-cons</b></a>, <a href="operators/jlinker/jget-meth.htm"><b>jget-meth</b></a>, and <a href="operators/jlinker/jarray-set.htm"><b>jarray-set</b></a>.)

<p id="141">
Additionally, <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> now has an
<i>end-function</i> keyword argument which, if supplied,
should name a function that will be called when jLinker stops. <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-listen.htm"><b>jlinker-listen</b></a> now
behaves differently when <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> fails: before
<a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-listen.htm"><b>jlinker-listen</b></a>
would exit when <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> failed. Now, the
function specified as the value of the
<i>process-function</i> is called and it is its
responsibility to decide whether to stop or continue when <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> returns a
failure message.
</p>

</li>
<li id="142">

<b>RPC changes</b>. There are some
some modifications to the rpc module (see <a href="rpc.htm">rpc.htm</a>
for a description of the module). The affected operators were <a href="operators/rpc/client-end-all.htm"><b>client-end-all</b></a> (new
optional arguments) and <a href="operators/rpc/run-other-client.htm"><b>run-other-client</b></a> (new

significant documentation changes to <a href="operators/rpc/run-other-lisp.htm"><b>run-other-lisp</b></a> and <a href="operators/rpc/rpc-close.htm"><b>rpc-close</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="143">

<b>New command-line argument +P</b>. If +p (lowercase p)
appears on the command line, +P (uppercase P) undoes its effect. (+p
may be present in the command-line resource for the executable. +P
allows cancelling the +p in such a case.) See <a href="startup.htm#command-line-args-1">Command line
arguments</a> in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for a list of
command-line arguments accepted by Allegro CL.

</li>
<li id="144">

<b>New support for constructing MIME messages</b>. See <a href="imap.htm#mime-1">MIME support</a> in
<a href="imap.htm">imap.htm</a> for more information. See particularly the
new function <a href="operators/post-office/make-mime-part.htm"><b>make-mime-part</b></a>. <a href="operators/post-office/send-letter.htm"><b>send-letter</b></a>,
<a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp.htm"><b>send-smtp</b></a>, and <a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp-auth.htm"><b>send-smtp-auth</b></a> have been enhanced
to allow files or streams (as well as a string) as the value of the
<i>message</i> argument. <a href="operators/post-office/send-letter.htm"><b>send-letter</b></a> also now accepts an
<i>attachments</i> keyword argument. 

</li>
<li id="145">

<b>Changes to mail functions allows specifying the mail server port

<b>New ability to invoke Lisp within a bat file on Windows</b>. You
can now execute Lisp programs contained within a bat file on Windows
so the bat file will invoke Lisp, run specified forms, and then exit
(optionally pausing before exiting). The function <a href="operators/excl/lisp-to-bat-file.htm"><b>lisp-to-bat-file</b></a> supports this new
facility. It writes an appropriate bat file when given a Lisp file of
forms to execute and provided some additonal information (such as what
image file to use). Also added are two new command-line arguments
<b>--bat</b> and <b>--bat-pause</b>. (See <a href="startup.htm#command-line-args-1">Command line arguments</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for a list of command-line arguments
accepted by Allegro CL.) This <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/tech_corner/windows_scripting.lhtml">Tech

defsystem utility (see <a href="defsystem.htm">defsystem.htm</a>) previously
returned t. It now returns a list of namestrings of the files
concatenated, in the order in which they appear in the concatenated
fasl file.

<li id="155">

<b>make-foreign-pointer has new aligned keyword argument</b>. If the
<i>aligned</i> keyword argument to <a href="operators/ff/make-foreign-pointer.htm"><b>make-foreign-pointer</b></a> is specified true, then the
address is interpreted as an aligned address and is shifted to become
a machine integer before storing. (Aligned pointers are described in
<a href="ftype.htm#aligned-pointers-1">Aligned
Pointers</a> in <a href="ftype.htm">ftype.htm</a>.)

<li id="156">

<b>Apparent misspelling in declarations now cause warnings</b>. Consider this code:
<pre id="157">
(defun foo (x1 y1) (declare (fixnum x2 y1)) (+ x1 y1))
</pre>
<p id="158">
The variable <code>x2</code> is declared to be a fixnum, but is
not actually lexically visible. Presumably the author meant to declare
<code>x1</code> to be a fixnum and just mistyped. This error
will make no difference to the code execution, though it might make a
difference to how the code is compiled. Allegro CL will now warn about
the unknown variable in the declaration. Note that this code will
(likely) cause two warnings
</p>
<pre id="159"> 
(defun bar () (declare (fixnum y1)) (+ 1 y1))
</pre>
<p id="160">
Here <code>y1</code> will be assumed to be special and (if
<code>y1</code> is otherwise not known about) a warning saying
that <code>y1</code> is assumed special will be signaled as will
the warning that a declaration refers to an unknown variable.

<b>Semaphores implemented for gates</b>. The functions <a href="operators/mp/get-semaphore.htm"><b>get-semaphore</b></a> and <a href="operators/mp/put-semaphore.htm"><b>put-semaphore</b></a> can be applied to gates to control
when a gate is opened or closed and by which process. Gates are

<a href="multiprocessing.htm">multiprocessing.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="163">

<b>Registered addresses of Lisp functions (for foreign callbacks) now
never move</b>.  When you want a Lisp function called from a foreign
function, you have to register it with <a href="operators/ff/register-foreign-callable.htm"><b>register-foreign-callable</b></a> (and
define it with <a href="operators/ff/defun-foreign-callable.htm"><b>defun-foreign-callable</b></a>). <a href="operators/ff/register-foreign-callable.htm"><b>register-foreign-callable</b></a> returns
the address of the Lisp wrapper function which is what is actually
called from the foreign code. In earlier releases, this address was
valid after a gc but was not valid after a <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>. Starting in release 8.1, it is
always valid. <a href="operators/ff/register-foreign-callable.htm"><b>register-foreign-callable</b></a> also
returns an index into a table that can be used to find the address. In
earlier releases, we instructed users to use the index to avoid having
an invalid address after a <a href="operators/excl/dumplisp.htm"><b>dumplisp</b></a>. That is no longer necessary but
using an index does have the advantage that it is always a fixnum
while the address may be a bignum.

</li>
<li id="164">

<b>with-auto-zoom-and-exit and zoom function now defined in
Lisp</b>. There is a new top-level.debug package and autozoom module
with two operators: the macro <a href="debugging.htm#with-auto-zoom-and-exit-op-bookmarkxx"><b>with-auto-zoom-and-exit</b></a> and the
function <a href="debugging.htm#zoom-op-bookmarkxx"><b>zoom</b></a>. In earlier releases,
<b>with-auto-zoom-and-exit</b> was defined in a source file but was
not part of Lisp as delivered. These functions allow you to get
debugging information programmatically. See <a href="debugging.htm#programmatic-backtrace-2">Getting a
backtrace programmatically</a> in
<a href="debugging.htm">debugging.htm</a>.

<li id="167">
<b>Errors are signaled more often for floating-point underflows and
overflows</b>. Code which used to simply return 0.0 (in an underflow
situation) or <code>excl::*infinity-single*</code>) in an
overflow now may error, signaling a floating-point-underflow or
floating-point-overflow error as appropriate. This change (which is
compliant with ANSI) allows users to control more precisely what they
want in these cases: 0.0, least-positive[something]-float, to switch
from singles to doubles, or whatever. But code which depended on the
older more tolerant behavior will now break. (for example,
<code>(read-from-string "4.9e-324")</code> signals an error
rather than rturning 0.0 and (expt most-positive-single-float 2)
signals an error rather than returning excl::*infinity-single*.) See
<a href="implementation.htm#infinities-nans-2">Floating-point infinities and NaNs, and
floating-point underflow and overflow</a> in
<a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a> for more information and sample
handler code to cath the errors. See also <a href="operators/excl/read-tiny-float.htm"><b>read-tiny-float</b></a> which can be used to read small
floats safely. As mentioned in
<a href="#acl-other-2">Section 6.3 Other changes to and notes about the base Lisp</a>, the infinity and NaN
constants are now exported.


</li>
<li id="168">
sys:*current-thread* is now a symbol-macro. Any reference to
sys:*current-thread* (except by symbol name) is automatically
transformed into a call to functionality which accesses and returns
the current thread object. This implementation is much more
efficient. User code should not have to be changed except for
references to the symbol name where the value is in some fashion used
(so applying <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/boundp.htm"><b>boundp</b></a> to
<code>'sys:*current-thread*</code> returns <code>nil</code> and applying <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/symbol-v.htm"><b>symbol-value</b></a> to it results in an error.
</li>
<li id="169">

<b>lisp_init() arguments changed</b>. The <i>quiet</i>
argument has been replaced by the
<i>tls_slot_index</i>. See <a href="main.htm">main.htm</a>
for a list of arguments and a discussion of this
change. (<i>quiet</i> was in fact unused. The discussion
is about the new argument.)

</li>
<li id="170">

<b>Foreign-functions macros with-static-fobject and
with-static-fobjects have changed argument lists</b>. The old argument
list was <code>((var type &etc) &rest
body)</code>. The new one is <code>((var type &key
allocation size) &rest body)</code>. The
<i>etc</i> argument was never documented and it is
unlikely that user code will be affected, but this is a
non-upward-compatible change. The new keyword arguments allow you to
say where the objects should be allocated and how big they should be
(though specifying <i>size</i> means the objects will
not be stack allocated). See also the entry on the new related macros

an optional <i>wrap-at-column</i> argument.  Now it is a
keyword argument.  The old style is still accepted for compatibility
(but is strongly discouraged; other keyword arguments cannot be
specified if the optional argument calling style is used). <a href="operators/excl/string-to-base64-string.htm"><b>string-to-base64-string</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/base64-string-to-string.htm"><b>base64-string-to-string</b></a> now accept

<code>(crlf-base-ef :latin1)</code>. <a href="operators/excl/base64-string-to-usb8-array.htm"><b>base64-string-to-usb8-array</b></a> accepts a new
keyword argument <i>output</i> which specifies the
buffer to use for the result.  If <i>output</i> is

<b>SOAP changes</b>: there are some relatively minor change to SOAP
(which is described in <a href="soap.htm">soap.htm</a>). These changes are

<ul>
<li id="175">

<b>Infinity and Nan constants are now exported</b>. See <a href="implementation.htm#infinities-nans-2">Floating-point
infinities and NaNs, and floating-point underflow and overflow</a> in

overflows and underflows now error more often (see
<a href="#acl-non-back-2">Section 6.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in the base Lisp</a>), so code like

<b>open runs significantly faster</b>. Opening files with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> is about twice as fast in 8.1 as
it was in 8.0. You can verify this by running the following function
in both versions:

<pre id="181">

<b>Warning is signaled for unused flet functions</b>. Allegro CL has

an aligned-pointer, or a <a href="classes/ff/foreign-pointer.htm"><code>foreign-pointer</code></a> with an address component that
is word-aligned. If it is a pointer, the <i>end</i>
keyword argument must also be specified (so the function can know how
long the vector is).

<b>lisp-implementation-version now returns two values, the second
identifying the shared library build number</b>. That detail may be
useful in assisting Franz in debugging a problem. See <a href="implementation.htm#cl-lisp-implementation-version-2">cl:lisp-implementation-version</a>
in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>. The first return value of
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/lisp-imp.htm"><b>cl:lisp-implementation-version</b></a>
is a string identifying the version number, the platform, and the date
the product was created.

</li>
<li id="185">

<b>Condition file-incompatible-fasl-error exported and
documented</b>. This is the condition signaled when you try to load
certain inappropriate fasl files into a Lisp image (such as fasl files
compiled in previous versions). The associated error has always been
signaled, but the condition, <a href="classes/excl/file-incompatible-fasl-error.htm"><code>file-incompatible-fasl-error</code></a> was not
previously exported (from the <code>excl</code> package).

</li>
<li id="186">

<b>New feature :verify-stack and new compiler switch
verify-stack-switch</b>.  On platforms with
<code>:verify-stack</code> on the <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/features.htm"><code>*features*</code></a> list, checking whether the stack
pointer has gone beyond the stack cushion is expensive. (A stack
cushion is an artifical stack limit. If Lisp can detect when this
limit is reached, it can warn that the stack is about to be exhausted
-- if the stack truly runs out, Lisp will fail.)  On such platforms,
the <a href="variables/compiler/verify-stack-switch.htm"><code>verify-stack-switch</code></a> controls whether stack
cushion checking is or is not done in compiled code.


</li>
<li id="187">

<b>console-control now has a title keyword argument</b>. With it,
<a href="operators/excl/console-control.htm"><b>console-control</b></a> (a function
only available on Windows) can set the title of the Allegro CL console
window.

</li>
<li id="188">

<b>fasl file headers have more (readable) information</b>. See
<a href="compiling.htm#fasl-files-2">Fasl files</a>
in <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>. There are 10 readable lines at
the top of a fasl file. The UNIX <b>head()</b> command will print the
readable head of a fasl file.

</li>
<li id="189">

<b>The address adjustment phase of a garbage collection has been sped
up</b>. The user-visible effect is in faster performance, but the
improvement is noticeable in images with a lot of data (test case
showed a 10x speed up, from several seconds to less than 0.3 seconds).

</li>
<li id="190">

<b>sys:update-allegro will tell you if there is a newer version of
AllegroCache or AllegroGraph available</b>. <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> does not itself download
the newer version, but it does tell you how you can get it.

</li>
<li id="191">

<b>Length and offset can be specified for mapped files</b>. Mapped
files are of stream class <a href="classes/excl/mapped-file-simple-stream.htm"><code>mapped-file-simple-stream</code></a>. They are created by
specifying <code>:mapped t</code> to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a>. <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> with <code>:mapped t</code> now
accepts <i>offset</i> and <i>length</i>
keyword arguments. The offset is the number of bytes beyond the start
of the file where the mapping begins, and the length is the length of
the mapping. (The <i>mapped</i> keyword argument is an
Allegro CL extension to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a>
and is described on the <a href="classes/excl/mapped-file-simple-stream.htm"><code>mapped-file-simple-stream</code></a> page.)

</li>
<li id="192">

<b>run-shell-command has a new keyword argument
:share-open-files</b>. This new argument to <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a>, for Windows only, allows
you to ensure that files opened by a call to <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a> are not shared.

<li id="193">

<b>match-re now opencodes even when :regexp2 has not been

<b>Certain CLIM demos on Solaris 64 bit give segv or otherwise fail
when displaying over the network, language environment must be set to

bringing up the environment, set the language/locale to "C". (On the
login screen, there's an "Options" button, which displays a menu that

Allegro CL (and CLIM), the demos work as long as the language/locale

the network. As of this writing, there is no fix for the problem.

<p id="203">
The <a href="#cg-non-back-2">first
subsection</a> describes changes to Common Graphics and
the IDE that are non backward-compatible. Please review this section
and make whatever necessary changes to your code to obtain the desired
behavior in release 8.1.
</p>
<p id="204">
The <a href="#cg-other-2">second subsection</a>
describes other changes to Common Graphics and the IDE. These should
not require code changes (please tell us if any do, because that may
indicate a bug), but note that certain function and argument names
have been deprecated in favor of new names, and that new code should
reflect these changes, and old code should be revised at some point.
</p>
<p id="205">
The section <a href="#ide-release-notes-2">Section 8.4 IDE release notes</a> and its
subsections provide information about the IDE.

<h3 id="207">
New chart drawing utility
</h3>

<p id="208">
A new widget allows drawing bar charts or equivalent line charts. See
<a href="cg/cg-chart-widget.htm">cg-chart-widget.htm</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="209">
New object-editor and class-grid widgets
</h3>

<p id="210">
These allow you to edit classes and instances. See <a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> and <a href="classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> and also <a href="cg/cg-object-editor-and-class-grid.htm">cg-object-editor-and-class-grid.htm</a>. There are many
additional classes and operators associated with these classes. They
are linked to from the class description pages.

<hr><h2 id="211"><a name="cg-non-back-2">8.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in Common Graphics</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="212">

<b>The cg-user package no longer uses the ide package</b>. To avoid
certain name conflicts, the cg-user package no longer uses the ide
package. Therefore, ide functionality must be package-qualified when
called from the Debug window when the current package is cg-user (as
it is when the Debug window is first displayed). This note is repeated
in the <a href="#ide-release-notes-2">IDE
section</a>.

</li>
<li id="213">

<b>Incompatible find-window change</b>.  The function <a href="operators/cg/f/find-window.htm"><b>find-window</b></a> now looks only for a child
window by default, rather than for either a child or owned window.  To
look for an owned window you must specify the new
<i>owned-p</i> keyword argument as true.  This is for
efficiency, to avoid looking at all top-level windows in the system
when calling <a href="operators/cg/f/find-window.htm"><b>find-window</b></a> on a
top-level window.  (For finding IDE windows, see the new IDE function
<a href="operators/ide/find-ide-window.htm"><b>find-ide-window</b></a>.)

</li>
<li id="214">

<b>Incompatible default for the proportional property of grid
subsections</b>. The default for the <a href="operators/cg/p/proportional.htm"><b>proportional</b></a> property of a <a href="classes/cg/grid-subsection.htm"><code>grid-subsection</code></a> (either a <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> or <a href="classes/cg/grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a>) has changed from <code>t</code> to <code>nil</code>. This item is
repeated, with more details, in
<a href="#grid-widget-changes-3">Section 8.3.1 Grid-widget-specific changes</a> below.

</li>
<li id="215">

<b>An obscure change to the value returned by
pop-up-message-dialog</b>.  For consistency, when there is only a
single choice in <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-message-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-message-dialog</b></a> and the user cancels the
dialog, it now returns 1 rather than 2 (and therefore <a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-choice.htm"><b>ask-user-for-choice</b></a> will return the
single choice rather than <code>nil</code>).

</li>
<li id="216">

<b>The value property of static-picture can no longer be used to set
the pixmap</b>.  As a long-time backward compatibility, you could set
the <a href="operators/cg/v/value.htm"><b>value</b></a> property of a
<a href="classes/cg/static-picture.htm"><code>static-picture</code></a> to be a
pixmap to specify the image to display.  This property is now used for
something else (see <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-alist.htm"><b>pixmap-alist</b></a>), and so you must use the <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap.htm"><b>pixmap</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-name.htm"><b>pixmap-name</b></a>, or <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-icon.htm"><b>pixmap-icon</b></a> property for the image, as
documented.

</li>
<li id="217">

<b>6.0 project tab control widgets may not display
properly</b>. Widgets on <a href="classes/cg/tab-control.htm"><code>tab-control</code></a>s may be hidden if the code that
creates them was generated for a form in a project and the code has
not been generated since the 6.0 release.  If this happens it can be
fixed by removing <b>:state :shrunk</b> initargs in the code that
creates the widgets.

</li>
<li id="218">

<b>define-project is now named by a common-graphics symbol</b>. In
earlier releases, <a href="operators/cg/d/define-project.htm"><b>define-project</b></a> was named by an ide package
symbol, but for technical reasons the symbol has been moved to the
common-graphics package. See the description of <a href="operators/cg/d/define-project.htm"><b>define-project</b></a>.

</li>
</ol>




<hr><h2 id="219"><a name="cg-other-2">8.3 Other changes in Common Graphics</a></h2>

<p id="220">
There are many changes to <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> functionality. They are listed in
<a href="#grid-widget-changes-3">Section 8.3.1 Grid-widget-specific changes</a> below.
</p>


<ol>

<li id="221">

<b>The IDE and generated CG applications will now use Microsoft Visual
Styles by default, for the newer Windows look</b>. To disable this
feature for a generated application, set the <a href="operators/ide/include-manifest-file-for-visual-styles.htm"><b>include-manifest-file-for-visual-styles</b></a>
property of the project to <code>nil</code>.  To disable
the feature for the IDE, rename the file <i>allegro.exe.manifest</i>
in the main Allegro directory to something else and restart the
IDE. The new function <a href="operators/cg/a/a-visual-style-is-active.htm"><b>a-visual-style-is-active</b></a> returns whether a
visual style is currently in effect, and <a href="operators/cg/s/selected-tab-color.htm"><b>selected-tab-color</b></a> returns the background color
of the body of a <a href="classes/cg/tab-control.htm"><code>tab-control</code></a> (which can now differ from the
<a href="operators/cg/s/system-dialog-background-color.htm"><b>system-dialog-background-color</b></a>).  Applications
may want to change the <a href="operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a> property of existing button
widgets to <code>t</code> so that the background just
outside of their rounded corners will match the color of the parent
window or tab-control.

</li>
<li id="222">

<b>lamp widget improvements including support for placing lamps on
grid-widgets</b>. There are a number of changes to the <a href="classes/cg/lamp.htm"><code>lamp</code></a> widget. The most important is
new support for placing lamps in cells of a <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>. See the description of the <a href="classes/cg/lamp.htm"><code>lamp</code></a> widget for details.
<p id="223">
Other changes include allowing arrays of lamps to have individual
<a href="operators/cg/o/on-color.htm"><b>on-color</b></a>s and <a href="operators/cg/o/off-color.htm"><b>off-color</b></a>s. The default for <a href="operators/cg/l/lamp-height.htm"><b>lamp-height</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/l/lamp-width.htm"><b>lamp-width</b></a> is now 10 pixels. It is no longer
computed using other factors.
</p>

</li>
<li id="224">

<b>New initial-focus argument to pop-up-message-dialog</b>. The
function <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-message-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-message-dialog</b></a>
has a new <b><i>initial-focus</i></b> keyword argument
that gets passed directly to <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-modal-dialog</b></a>. It specifies which widget
on the pop-up dialog will have ficus, and its possible values include
<code>:default</code> (for the leftmost button),
<code>:cancel</code> (for the rightmost button), or
<code>:button</code><code><i>n</i></code>, for button numbered <i>n</i> (see
the function description for exact details).


</li>
<li id="225">

<b>Menu bars are now possible on child windows on the Windows
platform</b>.  There are some caveats. They are discussed in the
description of <a href="operators/cg/m/menu.htm"><b>menu</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="226">

<b>New function menu-bar-height</b>. The <a href="operators/cg/m/menu-bar-height.htm"><b>menu-bar-height</b></a> function returns the standard
height of a menu bar. Because child window menu bars (see previous
entry) are not part of the window's frame, they must be placed in the
user coordinate system of the window. Widgets in the window must be
placed so they do not overlap the menu bar. You use this function to
know how much space to set aside.

</li>
<li id="227">

<b>return-crlf argument to various functions no longer has any
effect</b>. The rather obscure <i>return-crlf</i>
keyword argument of the user functions <a href="operators/cg/t/text-range.htm"><b>text-range</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/g/get-text.htm"><b>get-text</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/r/rich-edit-range.htm"><b>rich-edit-range</b></a> has been deprecated and no
longer has any effect.  It did not appear feasible to implement it
with the newer version of the RichEdit control that CG now uses, and
should no longer be useful now that the control internally uses a
single character for each newline.  The argument had been offered as a
way to cause the character indexes of a string that's read from the
control to match their indexes in the control itself, but that is now
true in the normal case.

</li>
<li id="228">

<b>New menu facility for many choices</b>.  The new function <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-menus-for-many-sorted-choices.htm"><b>pop-up-menus-for-many-sorted-choices</b></a>
takes a potentially huge list of pre-sorted choices and presents them
to the user as a series of pop-up menus. This makes it feasible to
select one of many choices by letting the user select each successive
unique character of the name of the choice from further pop-up menus.

</li>
<li id="229">

<b>New scrolling-static-text widget</b>. The <a href="classes/cg/scrolling-static-text.htm"><code>scrolling-static-text</code></a> widget allows you to
easily place into a dialog a block of text that automatically wraps at
spaces at the widget's width and which also scrolls vertically as
needed.  This had been possible to achieve previously by using a
<a href="classes/cg/multi-line-editable-text.htm"><code>multi-line-editable-text</code></a>
and setting properties such as <a href="operators/cg/r/read-only.htm"><b>read-only</b></a> to true, <a href="operators/cg/b/border.htm"><b>border</b></a> to <code>:none</code>, and <a href="operators/cg/b/background-color.htm"><b>background-color</b></a> to <code>t</code> (to match the parent window), but on GTK it was not
possible to change the background color from white.  Pertinent
properties of this widget include <a href="operators/cg/v/value.htm"><b>value</b></a> (the string to display), <a href="operators/cg/h/horizontal-justification.htm"><b>horizontal-justification</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/v/vertical-justification.htm"><b>vertical-justification</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/m/margin-around-text.htm"><b>margin-around-text</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-focus.htm"><b>draw-focus</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/b/border.htm"><b>border</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/b/border-color.htm"><b>border-color</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="230">

<b>The text-editing widget uses a newer version of Microsoft's
RichEdit control</b>.  On Windows, the CG <a href="classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm"><code>text-edit-pane</code></a> and <a href="classes/cg/rich-edit-pane.htm"><code>rich-edit-pane</code></a> windows (and the <a href="classes/cg/multi-line-editable-text.htm"><code>multi-line-editable-text</code></a> and
<a href="classes/cg/rich-edit.htm"><code>rich-edit</code></a> widgets that use
them) now use version 2 or 3 (depending on the version of Windows) of
Microsoft's RichEdit control, rather than version 1 as before.  This
newer version features multi-level undo and redo (for which the IDE
has a new <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#redo">Edit | Redo</a> command, and CG has the new user
function <a href="operators/cg/r/redo-command.htm"><b>redo-command</b></a>).  It
may have better support for Input Method Editors and be more robust
generally.  If necessary, an application could revert to RichEdit
version 1 by setting <code>excl::*richedit-v2*</code> to <code>nil</code>, or even revert to the US NT4.0 version of
RichEdit version 1 that we ship by also setting
<code>excl::*use-aclre32.dll*</code> to true; please tell us if
you find either of these steps necessary so that we can retain these
deprecated options as needed.

</li>
<li id="231">

<b>Faster mouse wheel scrolling in the text-editing widget</b>.  CG
overrides the new slower style of mouse wheel scrolling that Microsoft
uses in newer versions of the RichEdit control with faster standard
mouse wheel scrolling.

</li>
<li id="232">

<b>HTML-browsing on GTK uses a third-party browser rather than a CG
widget</b>.  On GTK, <a href="operators/cg/i/invoke-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-html-browser</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/i/invoke-private-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-private-html-browser</b></a> will no longer defer
to using a CG html browser, due to the unpredictability of the Mozilla
GTK widget on which it is built.  Instead, <a href="operators/cg/i/invoke-private-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-private-html-browser</b></a> will first attempt
to invoke a standalone Firefox HTML browser program by using <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a>, and if that fails
it will simply place the URL or file path onto the system clipboard
for the user to paste into an HTML browser by hand.  And <a href="operators/cg/i/invoke-html-browser.htm"><b>invoke-html-browser</b></a> will skip the
Firefox attempt altogether and use the clipboard directly.
</li>
<li id="233">

<b>New functions return the available coordinate space across multiple
monitors</b>.  The new functions <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-screen-left.htm"><b>virtual-screen-left</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-screen-top.htm"><b>virtual-screen-top</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-screen-width.htm"><b>virtual-screen-width</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-screen-height.htm"><b>virtual-screen-height</b></a> return coordinates that
denote the extent of all monitors in a multiple-monitor system. They
will return 0, 0, <code>(screen-width)</code>, and
<code>(screen-height)</code> for single-monitor systems as well
as for all systems on GTK.  The new functions <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-exterior.htm"><b>virtual-exterior</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/n/nvirtual-exterior.htm"><b>nvirtual-exterior</b></a> return a box that combines
these four values (when called on the screen; they are the same as
<a href="operators/cg/e/exterior.htm"><b>exterior</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/n/nexterior.htm"><b>nexterior</b></a> when called on a window).  The <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-screen-left.htm"><b>virtual-screen-left</b></a> may be negative
when a secondary monitor is configured to the left of the primary
monitor.

</li>
<li id="234">

<b>Other functions for the usable coordinate space work better with
multiple monitors</b>.  The new functions <a href="operators/cg/u/usable-left.htm"><b>usable-left</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/u/usable-top.htm"><b>usable-top</b></a> will return zero for windows.  For
the screen, they will return <code>(virtual-screen-left)</code>
and <code>(virtual-screen-top)</code> for a multiple monitor
system, or the left and top of the interior of the screen for a single
monitor system.  The pre-existing functions <a href="operators/cg/u/usable-width.htm"><b>usable-width</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/u/usable-height.htm"><b>usable-height</b></a> will still return the <a href="operators/cg/p/page-width.htm"><b>page-width</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/p/page-height.htm"><b>page-height</b></a> of a window, or <a href="operators/cg/i/interior-width.htm"><b>interior-width</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/i/interior-height.htm"><b>interior-height</b></a> of the screen in a single
monitor system, as before; but for the screen of a multiple-monitor
system, they will now return <code>(virtual-screen-width)</code>
and <code>(virtual-screen-height)</code>.

</li>
<li id="235">

<b>Tooltips are placed correctly on a secondary monitor that's on the
left</b>.  A tooltip that should appear on a secondary monitor that is
configured to the left of the primary monitor (in negative
coordinates) had gotten moved to the primary monitor.

</li>
<li id="236">

<b>The new function frameless-topmost-p may be useful on GTK</b>.
<a href="operators/cg/f/frameless-topmost-p.htm"><b>frameless-topmost-p</b></a> is an
overridable generic function that should return true if and only if
instances of a window class should use the GTK_WINDOW_POPUP style on
GTK.  This is the only known way on GTK to make a non-child window
that has no button in the taskbar.  This property also forces the
window to be frameless and topmost (in front of all non-topmost
windows in all applications), and so is suitable only for true
temporary "pop-up" windows such as menus and tooltips.  This generic
function has no effect on the Windows platform.  To make a top-level
window on Windows that has no taskbar button, either give it an owner
window or specify its border property as :palette.  (You can
optionally eliminate the palette frame by also specifying the <a href="operators/cg/t/title-bar.htm"><b>title-bar</b></a> property as <code>nil</code>.)

</li>
<li id="237">

<b>You can now grab the image from a hidden window</b>.  Calling
<a href="operators/cg/g/get-pixmap.htm"><b>get-pixmap</b></a> on any window whose
<a href="operators/cg/d/double-buffered.htm"><b>double-buffered</b></a> property is
true now works when the window is covered or shrunk, by grabbing the
pixels from the backing store rather than from the screen.

</li>
<li id="238">

<b>New options for the directory dialog</b>. There is a new
<i>show-initial-directory-children</i> argument for
<a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-new-or-existing-directory.htm"><b>ask-user-for-new-or-existing-directory</b></a>. There is
also a <i>search-network-globally</i> argument to
specify whether to search the network globally or only in the current
context to find the machines to list. This argument is passed to
<a href="operators/windows/network-machines.htm"><b>win:network-machines</b></a>,
where it may affect performance or which machines are included.

</li>
<li id="239">

<b>pop-up-lettered-menu has a new sort-key keyword argument</b>. This
new argument allows you to specify a key function for the
<i>sort-predicate</i> function. It acts like the
<i>key</i> argument to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/sortstab.htm"><b>sort</b></a>. See <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-lettered-menu.htm"><b>pop-up-lettered-menu</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="240">

<b>New show-help-string-under-mouse property; help-string property
added to hotspots</b>.  The new widget/window/hotspot property <a href="operators/cg/s/show-help-string-under-mouse.htm"><b>show-help-string-under-mouse</b></a>
determines whether the object's <a href="operators/cg/h/help-string.htm"><b>help-string</b></a> is shown in a status-bar whenever
the mouse is over it.  And the existing <a href="operators/cg/h/help-string.htm"><b>help-string</b></a> property has been added to <a href="classes/cg/hotspot.htm"><code>hotspot</code></a>s.

</li>
<li id="241">

<b>New hidden-buttons property for multi-picture-button</b>.  The
<a href="operators/cg/h/hidden-buttons.htm"><b>hidden-buttons</b></a> property can be
a list of button names to hide on a <a href="classes/cg/multi-picture-button.htm"><code>multi-picture-button</code></a> when they are not
applicable in the current context.  This is simpler than replacing the
entire list of <a href="classes/cg/button-info.htm"><code>button-info</code></a>
objects in the <a href="operators/cg/r/range.htm"><b>range</b></a> property,
and retains the order of the buttons when they are added back.

</li>
<li id="242">

<b>New function require-cg-acache</b>.  <a href="operators/cg/r/require-cg-acache.htm"><b>require-cg-acache</b></a> will load the newest version
of AllegroCache that you have downloaded (unless AllegroCache is
already loaded), and then load the CG module that depends on
AllegroCache.  This function is exported in case this loading is not
always done automatically when needed.

</li>
<li id="243">

<b>A generic function for hiding properties</b>.  The function <a href="operators/cg/p/property-hidden.htm"><b>property-hidden</b></a> is now exported,
similar to other attributes of property objects such as <a href="operators/cg/p/property-reader.htm"><b>property-reader</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/p/property-read-only.htm"><b>property-read-only</b></a>.  Methods could be added
that determine whether particular user-defined properties (see <a href="operators/cg/d/defproperties.htm"><b>defproperties</b></a>) appear in the
inspector.

</li>
<li id="244">

<b>The template-string facility has been improved</b>. There are new
choices in <a href="variables/cg/s_template-chars_s.htm"><code>*template-chars*</code></a> for a <a href="operators/cg/t/template-string.htm"><b>template-string</b></a>. The new function <a href="operators/cg/d/digit-char-or-space-p.htm"><b>digit-char-or-space-p</b></a> can be used as a
template char predicate function.  Handling of the Delete, Backspace,
Home, and End keys is more useful.  Typing with the text cursor at the
rightmost position will now insert characters and shift existing
characters leftward; the Delete key in this position will shift
characters rightward.  The <a href="operators/cg/o/on-change.htm"><b>on-change</b></a> function is no longer called on every
keystroke of an editable-text that has a template string and whose
<a href="operators/cg/d/delayed.htm"><b>delayed</b></a> property is true.
Selecting text with the shift key down is now allowed to work as
usual.  Typing a character while all text is selected now first clears
the string to its default print string before inserting the typed
character.  There is no longer a break when the current widget value
is not the same length as the template-string.  Pasting into the
widget will coerce the string to fit the template.  The new <a href="operators/cg/t/template-allows-sign.htm"><b>template-allows-sign</b></a> property allows
the user to type a plus or minus character to the left of all
non-whitespace characters.

</li>
<li id="245">

<b>New standard light colors</b>.  The new global variables <a href="variables/cg/light-red.htm"><code>light-red</code></a>, <a href="variables/cg/light-green.htm"><code>light-green</code></a>, <a href="variables/cg/light-blue.htm"><code>light-blue</code></a>, <a href="variables/cg/light-yellow.htm"><code>light-yellow</code></a>, <a href="variables/cg/light-cyan.htm"><code>light-cyan</code></a>, and <a href="variables/cg/light-magenta.htm"><code>light-magenta</code></a> have been added to
go with existing color variables like <a href="variables/cg/red.htm"><code>red</code></a> and <a href="variables/cg/dark-red.htm"><code>dark-red</code></a>.

</li>
<li id="246">

<b>New extendable generic function screen-resolution-changed</b>.
<a href="operators/cg/s/screen-resolution-changed.htm"><b>screen-resolution-changed</b></a> will
be called whenever the size of the screen has changed, such as when
using Remote Desktop or attaching a second monitor.  An application
could add a method that moves or resizes windows at this time.

</li>
<li id="247">

<b>Moving edited text with the mouse</b>.  The control-left-click
gesture in a <a href="classes/cg/lisp-edit-pane.htm"><code>lisp-edit-pane</code></a>
(such as in the IDE editor) to copy the expression at the click
position to the text cursor position will now reindent the copied
lines.  And a new control-shift-left-click command will move the text
rather than copying it.

</li>
<li id="248">

<b>Static-picture widgets and the new pixmap-displaying grid cells
allow cycling through a set of pixmaps</b>.  A <a href="classes/cg/static-picture.htm"><code>static-picture</code></a> widget can now draw a pixmap that
is mapped from an arbitrary user value to a pixmap by the new <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-alist.htm"><b>pixmap-alist</b></a> property.  (This is also
a feature of the new pixmap-displaying grid cells.)  The new property
<a href="operators/cg/u/user-modifiable.htm"><b>user-modifiable</b></a> determines
whether the user is allowed to cycle through the pixmaps, which they
do by clicking the widget or grid cell or by pressing the spacebar
when it has the keyboard focus.  The new <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-value-test.htm"><b>pixmap-value-test</b></a> property determines whether a
new user value matches an entry in the <a href="operators/cg/p/pixmap-alist.htm"><b>pixmap-alist</b></a>.  A <a href="classes/cg/static-picture.htm"><code>static-picture</code></a> widget now has the <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-focus.htm"><b>draw-focus</b></a> property like <a href="classes/cg/picture-button.htm"><code>picture-button</code></a>, as well as the
<a href="operators/cg/t/tabstop.htm"><b>tabstop</b></a> property.

</li>
<li id="249">

<b>above-parent property of outline-items and handle-above-parent
property of outlines</b>. Both these properties were available in
release 8.0 but not documented. They now are documented. They allow
specifying whether an <a href="classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a> is displayed above its parent (when
<a href="operators/cg/a/above-parent.htm"><b>above-parent</b></a> is set to true
and the <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-above-parent.htm"><b>handle-above-parent</b></a>
property of the <a href="classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> is
also true).

</li>
<li id="250">

<b>New arguments avoid consing RGB objects</b>.  The functions <a href="operators/cg/m/make-rgb.htm"><b>make-rgb</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/effective-background-color.htm"><b>effective-background-color</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/e/effective-foreground-color.htm"><b>effective-foreground-color</b></a> take a new
<i>scratch-rgb</i> keyword argument, which can be used
to prevent the function from ever consing a new RGB object.

</li>
<li id="251">

<b>Outline-items can be placed above their parent items</b>.  The
<a href="classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> widget has a new
option to position some child items above their parent items.  This
might be useful for indicating that a child item is special in some
way.  The child outline-item's <a href="operators/cg/a/above-parent.htm"><b>above-parent</b></a> property must be true, and the
outline's <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-above-parent.htm"><b>handle-above-parent</b></a>
property must be true.  This feature can slow down the redisplay of a
large outline, but only when the outline's <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-above-parent.htm"><b>handle-above-parent</b></a> option is turned on.

</li>
<li id="252">

<b>New function scroll-window-into-parent</b>.  The new user function
<a href="operators/cg/s/scroll-window-into-parent.htm"><b>scroll-window-into-parent</b></a>
scrolls a parent window so that the specified child window is fully
visible (when possible).

</li>
<li id="253">

<b>Using get-screen-box without drawing the box</b>.  The function
<a href="operators/cg/g/get-screen-box.htm"><b>get-screen-box</b></a> has a new
<i>no-draw</i> keyword argument that avoids drawing the
rubber-banding box.  The function <a href="operators/cg/g/get-screen-pixmap.htm"><b>get-screen-pixmap</b></a> also has this new argument,
which may be needed if the screen is being redrawn in some way as you
select the region to capture.

</li>
<li id="254">

<b>Timers remember their next fire time.</b> The new <a href="operators/cg/t/timer-universal-time.htm"><b>timer-universal-time</b></a> property of the <a href="classes/cg/timer.htm"><code>timer</code></a> class stores the universal
time at which the timer is currently set to go off, or <code>nil</code> when the timer is not set.  (Not useful for
sub-second times.)

</li>
<li id="255">

<b>New macros with-fill-texture, with-background-texture, and
with-line-texture</b>. The new macros <a href="operators/cg/w/with-fill-texture.htm"><b>with-fill-texture</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/w/with-background-texture.htm"><b>with-background-texture</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/w/with-line-texture.htm"><b>with-line-texture</b></a> temporarily sets the <a href="operators/cg/f/fill-texture.htm"><b>fill-texture</b></a>/<a href="operators/cg/b/background-texture.htm"><b>background-texture</b></a>/<a href="operators/cg/l/line-texture.htm"><b>line-texture</b></a> of a stream, similar to existing
macros for other drawing attributes such as <a href="operators/cg/w/with-foreground-color.htm"><b>with-foreground-color</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/w/with-line-width.htm"><b>with-line-width</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="256">

<b>It is easier to add keyboard scrolling behavior to an arbitrary
window</b>.  You can enable the new <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-scrolling-keys.htm"><b>handle-scrolling-keys</b></a> window property by passing
<i>handle-scrolling-keys</i> initarg to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> or by calling <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-scrolling-keys.htm"><b>(setf
handle-scrolling-keys)</b></a> later.  If the user types PageUp,
PageDown, or an arrow key, and no more-specific <a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-key-down.htm"><b>virtual-key-down</b></a> method intercepts the
keystroke, then a built-in method will now scroll the window by the
amount returned by a call to <a href="operators/cg/s/scroll-increment.htm"><b>scroll-increment</b></a>.  (The
<i>type</i> argument to scroll-increment will be
<code>:page</code> for the PageUp and PageDown keys, or
<code>:line</code> for the arrow keys.)  If the control key is
held down, then the window will scroll horizontally, and otherwise it
will scroll vertically.  Previously you needed to write a custom
<a href="operators/cg/v/virtual-key-down.htm"><b>virtual-key-down</b></a> method to
gain this behavior.  The <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-scrolling-keys.htm"><b>handle-scrolling-keys</b></a> value may be <code>t</code> to handle all page and arrow keys,
<code>:vertical</code> to exclude the horizontal arrow keys, or
<code>:page</code> to exclude all arrow keys.

</li>
<li id="257">

<b>The initial-focus argument to pop-up-modal-dialog is more
flexible</b>. <i>initial-focus</i> argument may now
alternately be the name of the widget rather than the widget itself.
And when the initial-focus widget is a regular button, it will now
also be the initial acting default button (as with <a href="operators/cg/s/set-default-button.htm"><b>set-default-button</b></a>). See <a href="operators/cg/p/pop-up-modal-dialog.htm"><b>pop-up-modal-dialog</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="258">

<b>You can determine if the user selected the Print To File
option</b>.  If the user selects the <b>Print To File</b> option of a
printer driver's <b>Print Job</b> dialog, then the <a href="operators/cg/f/filename.htm"><b>filename</b></a> property of the printer stream will be
<code>t</code> rather than <code>nil</code> to
indicate that a print-to-file was done.  (It does not appear feasible
to find the actual path that the user specified interactively.)

</li>
<li id="259">

<b>list-widget-set-index can now trigger the on-change function</b>.
It has been inconsistent that calls to <a href="operators/cg/l/list-widget-set-index.htm"><b>list-widget-set-index</b></a> do not cause the widget's
<a href="operators/cg/o/on-change.htm"><b>on-change</b></a> function to be
called, so you can now pass the new
<i>trigger-on-change</i> keyword argument to make that
happen.  It is <code>nil</code> by default for backward
compatibility, though it is typically best to pass it as true.

</li>
<li id="260">

<b>New aid for displaying a document in a third-party program</b>.
The new Windows-only function <a href="operators/cg/w/windows-command-for-document-type.htm"><b>windows-command-for-document-type</b></a> returns a
command-line string that can be used with <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a> to invoke whatever program
is registered for handling files of a specified file type.  The
<b>setf</b> can even be used to register a particular program for some
file type.

</li>
<li id="261">

<b>Additional def-cg-ocx-control arguments for the Components
Toolbar</b>.  The function <a href="operators/cg/d/def-cg-ocx-control.htm"><b>def-cg-ocx-control</b></a> has the new keyword arguments
<i>toolbar-after</i>,
<i>toolbar-tooltip</i>, and
<i>toolbar-help-string</i>.  These arguments are passed
through to <a href="operators/ide/add-to-component-toolbar.htm"><b>add-to-component-toolbar</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="262">

<b>New drawing functions let you avoid creating position objects</b>.
The new functions <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-box-x-y.htm"><b>draw-box-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-by-x-y.htm"><b>draw-by-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-line-x-y.htm"><b>draw-line-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/f/fill-box-x-y.htm"><b>fill-box-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/erase-to-x-y.htm"><b>erase-to-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/erase-by-x-y.htm"><b>erase-by-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/erase-box-x-y.htm"><b>erase-box-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/erase-contents-box-x-y.htm"><b>erase-contents-box-x-y</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/e/erase-line-x-y.htm"><b>erase-line-x-y</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/i/invert-box-x-y.htm"><b>invert-box-x-y</b></a> allow drawing lines and boxes
without first creating position objects from the x and y coordinates.

</li>
<li id="263">

<b>You can check whether certain objects have user modifications to
save</b>.  The newly-exported generic function <a href="operators/cg/m/modified.htm"><b>modified</b></a> returns whether an object has unsaved
user changes.  Applicable classes in which an application may be
interested include <a href="classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm"><code>text-edit-pane</code></a>, <a href="classes/cg/rich-edit.htm"><code>rich-edit</code></a>, <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>, and <a href="classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>.

</li>
<li id="264">

<b>There is a new macro to temporarily allocate a color</b>.  The
newly exported macro <a href="operators/cg/w/with-rgb.htm"><b>with-rgb</b></a>
allows temporarily using an RGB object rather than consing one.

</li>
<li id="265">

<b>Rich-edit opening and saving can handle plain text</b>. The
function <a href="operators/cg/r/rich-edit-open.htm"><b>rich-edit-open</b></a> takes
a new <i>allowed-types</i> argument to pass to <a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-existing-pathname.htm"><b>ask-user-for-existing-pathname</b></a>.  The
function <a href="operators/cg/r/rich-edit-save.htm"><b>rich-edit-save</b></a> takes
a new <i>format</i> argument like that of <a href="operators/cg/r/rich-edit-range.htm"><b>rich-edit-range</b></a>, which allows saving
the contents as plain text rather than rich text.  The function
<a href="operators/cg/r/rich-edit-save-as.htm"><b>rich-edit-save-as</b></a> takes both
of these arguments, where <i>allowed-types</i> defaults
to <code>(("Rich text" . "*.rtf"))</code> when
<i>format</i> is <code>:rich-text</code> or to
<code>(("Text" . "*.txt"))</code> when
<i>format</i> is <code>:text</code>.

</li>
<li id="266">

<b>Keystrokes to open descendent items of an outline-item and
cancelling opening</b>. Control-clicking the icon of an <a href="classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a> in an <a href="classes/cg/outline.htm"><code>outline</code></a> widget or selecting the
item and pressing control-right-arrow opens all descendents. If there
are very many (or perhaps the items loop), this can take a long time
and can be canceled with the Escape key. See <a href="operators/cg/r/range-on-open.htm"><b>range-on-open</b></a>.

<li id="267">

Drawing functions are now generic. Drawing functions (which are mostly
named <b>draw-<i>something</i></b> or <b>erase-<i>something</i></b>
though there are additional ones) have been a mix of generic functions
and non-generic functions, and not for any particularly good
reason. They are now generic functions. The following have been
changed from regular to generic in release 8.1:

<hr><h2 id="269"><a name="grid-widget-changes-3">8.3.1 Grid-widget-specific changes</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="270">

<b>New grid-widget utility functions invalidate-whole-section and
cross-section-box</b>.  The new function <a href="operators/cg/i/invalidate-whole-section.htm"><b>invalidate-whole-section</b></a> invalidates a grid
section or subsection, while <a href="operators/cg/c/cross-section-box.htm"><b>cross-section-box</b></a> returns a box for the
intersection of a row or row-section with a column or column-section.

</li>
<li id="271">

<b>New grid-widget properties cache-cell-values and
delay-write-cell-value</b>. When <a href="operators/cg/c/cache-cell-values.htm"><b>cache-cell-values</b></a> is true, cell values are
cached, allowing them to be retrieved more quickly. You can also use
<a href="operators/cg/d/delay-write-cell-value.htm"><b>delay-write-cell-value</b></a> to wait
until a number of changes (often on a dialog) are made and then write
them all at once or cancel them.

</li>
<li id="272">

<b>The function delete-selected-subsections is more modifiable</b>.
The <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> function
<a href="operators/cg/d/delete-selected-subsections.htm"><b>delete-selected-subsections</b></a>
now calls the exported generic functions <a href="operators/cg/d/delete-row.htm"><b>delete-row</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/d/delete-column.htm"><b>delete-column</b></a> for each deleted subsection so
that you can add wrapper methods for side effects, such as deleting
the <a href="operators/cg/d/data-object.htm"><b>data-object</b></a> of each
deleted row.

</li>
<li id="273">

<b>Minimum size is implemented for grid-widget sections</b>.  The
existing <a href="operators/cg/m/minimum-size.htm"><b>minimum-size</b></a> property
is now also a property of <a href="classes/cg/grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a>, <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a>, <a href="classes/cg/grid-row-section.htm"><code>grid-row-section</code></a>, and <a href="classes/cg/grid-column-section.htm"><code>grid-column-section</code></a>. It can have the value
<code>nil</code> for those objects, which means inherit
from the value for the whole <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>.

</li>
<li id="274">

<b>New grid-column properties</b>.  The <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> class now implements the existing
properties <a href="operators/cg/h/horizontal-justification.htm"><b>horizontal-justification</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/v/vertical-justification.htm"><b>vertical-justification</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/s/single-line.htm"><b>single-line</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/o/on-print.htm"><b>on-print</b></a>.  It also defines the new properties
<a href="operators/cg/h/horizontal-padding.htm"><b>horizontal-padding</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/v/vertical-padding.htm"><b>vertical-padding</b></a>.  Some of these can
be given to a <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a>
instance instead of defining methods on column and row classes for
generic functions such as <a href="operators/cg/c/cell-horizontal-justification.htm"><b>cell-horizontal-justification</b></a> and <a href="operators/cg/c/cell-horizontal-padding.htm"><b>cell-horizontal-padding</b></a>. 

</li>
<li id="275">

<b>New data-slot property of grid-column</b>.  A <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> may now be given a <a href="operators/cg/d/data-slot.htm"><b>data-slot</b></a> property as an alternative to the
<a href="operators/cg/d/data-reader.htm"><b>data-reader</b></a> property.  This is
useful when the slot does not have a reader and/or writer function or
those functions are not known.

</li>
<li id="276">

<b>delete-selected-subsections returns a meaningful value</b>. The
return value from the <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> function <a href="operators/cg/d/delete-selected-subsections.htm"><b>delete-selected-subsections</b></a> is now the list of
subsections that were deleted. This is <code>nil</code> if
no subsections were selected or if the user canceled the confirmation
dialog.

</li>
<li id="277">

<b>New grid-widget cell type for displaying choices as pixmaps</b>.
The new <a href="classes/cg/pixmap-column-mixin.htm"><code>pixmap-column-mixin</code></a>
class can be used for displaying pixmaps in grid cells. Multiple
pixmaps can be supplied to represent various possible user values.
Clicking the cell (or pressing the spacebar when the cell has the
keyboard focus) will cycle to the next pixmap and write the value that
it represents back into user data.  This class is similar to existing
classes like <a href="classes/cg/editable-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>editable-text-column-mixin</code></a>.

</li>
<li id="278">

<b>New extendable grid-widget generic function
subsection-sequence-changed</b>.  An application could define methods
on the new generic function <a href="operators/cg/s/subsection-sequence-changed.htm"><b>subsection-sequence-changed</b></a> in order to catch
any time that the sequence of rows or columns in a <a href="classes/cg/grid-section.htm"><code>grid-section</code></a> has changed.  It is
called when the user interactively slides rows or columns to change
their order, and when the sequence is changed by calls to <a href="operators/cg/s/subsections.htm"><b>(setf subsections)</b></a>,
<a href="operators/cg/a/add-row.htm"><b>add-row</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/a/add-column.htm"><b>add-column</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/d/delete-row.htm"><b>delete-row</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/d/delete-column.htm"><b>delete-column</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="279">

<b>Centered check-boxes in grid cells</b>.  If a check-box grid column
has no <a href="operators/cg/t/title-reader.htm"><b>title-reader</b></a>, meaning
that there will never be text in the cell, then the check-box will now
be centered horizontally.

</li>
<li id="280">

<b>Grid-widgets show unavailable status</b>.  A <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> will now be drawn by default with a
gray foreground color when its <a href="operators/cg/a/available.htm"><b>available</b></a> property is <code>nil</code>.

</li>
<li id="281">

<b>The template-string facility now works in grid-widgets</b>.  The
<a href="classes/cg/editable-text-column-mixin.htm"><code>editable-text-column-mixin</code></a>
class and the <a href="classes/cg/combo-box-column-mixin.htm"><code>combo-box-column-mixin</code></a> class now have a <a href="operators/cg/t/template-string.htm"><b>template-string</b></a> property to make
type-in work as with the existing <a href="operators/cg/t/template-string.htm"><b>template-string</b></a> facility of an <a href="classes/cg/editable-text.htm"><code>editable-text</code></a> widget.

</li>
<li id="282">

<b>Incompatible default change for the proportional property of grid
subsections</b>.  The default value for the <a href="operators/cg/p/proportional.htm"><b>proportional</b></a> property of a <a href="classes/cg/grid-subsection.htm"><code>grid-subsection</code></a> (either a <a href="classes/cg/grid-column.htm"><code>grid-column</code></a> or <a href="classes/cg/grid-row.htm"><code>grid-row</code></a>) has changed from <code>t</code> to <code>nil</code>, because it is
typically more useful to create them at a size that fits their content
rather than making them stretch to fit the parent <a href="classes/cg/grid-section.htm"><code>grid-section</code></a>.  The default for <a href="classes/cg/grid-section.htm"><code>grid-section</code></a> is still <code>t</code>.  Any application code that did not specify this
property for grid columns or rows and depends on it to be true should
add <code>:proportional t</code> initargs to the calls to
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a> that create the
columns and rows.

</li>
<li id="283">

<b>Moving to the very end of a grid-section with PageUp and
PageDown</b>.  When scrolling a <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> section with the PageUp and PageDown
keys, if the section is already scrolled to the end then a further
keystroke will move the focus to the endmost subsection.  This makes
it easier to move all the way to the end subsection when the Home and
End keys won't do it because the focus is in an editable text cell.

<hr><h2 id="284"><a name="ide-release-notes-2">8.4 IDE release notes</a></h2>

<ol>

<li id="285">

<b>Non-backward-compatible change: you may need to qualify IDE
symbols</b>. The <code>cg-user</code> package no longer uses the
ide package, to avoid a problem where a local variable in user code
that has the same name as an exported IDE symbol would be written into
the user's fasl file as the symbol in the ide package.  This would
break in a standalone application where the ide package does not
exist. This change means that when in the cg-user package in the IDE,
you must add an ide: package qualifier to any IDE symbols that you use
programmatically. (This item also appears in
<a href="#cg-non-back-2">Section 8.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in Common Graphics</a> above.)

</li>
<li id="286">

<b>The IDE now uses a parent window rather than an owner window</b>.
The <a href="operators/ide/use-ide-parent-window.htm"><b>use-ide-parent-window</b></a> IDE
configuration option is now turned on by default on the Windows
platform (as on GTK before), now that we have implemented a way for
form windows to have menu-bars when they are child windows.  The IDE's
main window also has scrollbars to allow arranging IDE tool windows
into a larger space than will fit on the screen.  Using an IDE command
to select an IDE tool window will automatically scroll it fully into
view.  There are also commands on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#manage">View | Manage Windows</a> menu
whose keyboard shortcuts can be used to scroll the entire IDE with
keystrokes at any time.

</li>
<li id="287">

<b>There is a new Class Interface Editor dialog in the IDE</b>.  The
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/class-interface-editor-dialog.htm">Class
Interface Editor</a> dialog allows you to interactively set up an
<a href="classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> dialog or
<a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> widget (which
are new in CG) for editing the slot values of the instances of some
class, typically from a database.  You can specify which slots should
have widgets or grid columns as well what type of widget to use for
each slot.  This creates the <a href="operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property for an <a href="classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> or <a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> interactively so that
you don't need to remember the format of that large property value and
write it by hand.

</li>
<li id="288">

<b>New Redo command for the editor</b>.  There is a new <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#redo">Redo</a>
command on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm">Edit
menu</a> (on the Windows platform only).  The keyboard shortcut
for the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#compile">File | Compile</a> command has changed from
control-Y to control-shift-Y so that the new <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#redo">Edit |
Redo</a> command can use control-Y to follow the usual
convention.

</li>
<li id="289">

<b>The name of the IDE options file now includes the lisp version</b>.
The name of the options file (aka <i>preferences</i> file) will now
include the major and minor version numbers of the lisp, as in
<b><i>allegro-prefs-8-1</i></b>.  This is to avoid a problem where
exiting one version of lisp and then starting an older version could
break because new configuration options saved by the newer version do
not exist in the older version.  This means that if you want to use an
existing options file when you install a new release of Allegro, you
will need to rename the options file accordingly.

</li>
<li id="290">

<b>New utility functions for debugging output to an IDE listener</b>.
The newly-exported macro <a href="operators/ide/with-output-to-ide-listener.htm"><b>with-output-to-ide-listener</b></a> and function <a href="operators/ide/format-debug.htm"><b>format-debug</b></a> make it convenient for
application code to write debugging output to the currently selected
IDE listener.

</li>
<li id="291">

<b>eval-in-listener-thread has new <i>funcall</i> option and a new
trap-errors keyword argument</b>. The function <a href="operators/ide/eval-in-listener-thread.htm"><b>eval-in-listener-thread</b></a> has a new keyword
argument to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a> (rather
than <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/eval.htm"><b>eval</b></a>) the main argument
(which should be a funcallable object that will be passed no
arguments). Another new keyword argument is
<i>trap-errors</i>. It controls handling of errors
signaled while the main argument is being evaluated or funcalled.

</li>
<li id="292">

<b>The positioning of the Debug Window and Editor has changed</b>.
The IDE's Debug Window and Editor now default to a larger size and are
placed side by side (though overlapped to make each one adequately
wide).

</li>
<li id="293">

<b>No Startup Action dialog until there are recent projects to
reopen</b>.  The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a> dialog will now appear
at IDE startup only if the <a href="operators/ide/ask-for-action-at-ide-startup.htm"><b>ask-for-action-at-ide-startup</b></a> option is enabled
(as before) <b>and</b> there is at least one previously opened project
that can be offered in the list of recent projects to reopen.

</li>
<li id="294">

<b>You can avoid the confirmation dialog for unqualified symbols</b>.
The new IDE configuration option <a href="operators/ide/ask-before-assuming-package.htm"><b>ask-before-assuming-package</b></a> determines whether
a confirmation dialog will appear if you invoke an IDE command in a
text control where there is a string that does not name a symbol in
the current package, but does name a symbol in some other package.
The default value is <code>nil</code>, meaning that the
IDE will proceed to act on that symbol without showing the
confirmation dialog. To restore the 8.0 behavior, where a dialog will
ask whether you intended to act on the found symbol, set this option
to true. The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/find-in-files-dialog.htm">Find
In Files</a> dialog will never pop up a dialog about the package,
as many users found that was more annoying than useful in this dialog.

</li>
<li id="295">

<b>Complete History Expression can now retrieve earlier matches</b>.
If you type the first part of a previously-evaluted form into an IDE
listener and then invoke the <b>Complete History Expression</b> button
(typically by typing its shortcut, alt-L), but the form that's copied
to the prompt is not the one that you're looking for, then you can
invoke the command repeatedly until the desired match appears at the
prompt.

</li>
<li id="296">

<b>The IDE will rescue windows that get moved off the screen</b>. If
you somehow manage to move an IDE tool dialog so that it is completely
off the screen, then the IDE will automatically move it into view the
next time you invoke the dialog with its usual command.  (Selecting
the window in the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#window-list">View |
Window List</a> window already did this.)

</li>
<li id="297">

<b>The patches dialog can handle firewall proxies</b>. The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/download-dialog.htm">Download Patches</a>
dialog now has widgets for specifying an HTTP proxy when needed.
These values (except for the password) are saved into the new <a href="operators/ide/default-http-proxy.htm"><b>default-http-proxy</b></a> IDE configuration
option to remember the values in future IDE sessions.

</li>
<li id="298">

<b>New function selected-listener-pane</b>. The function <a href="operators/ide/selected-listener-pane.htm"><b>selected-listener-pane</b></a> has been
exported for returning the currently-selected IDE listener pane.  It
may be desirable to print debugging output to this particular stream.

</li>
<li id="299">

<b>A new macro for printing to the IDE listener</b>.  The macro
<a href="operators/ide/with-output-to-ide-listener.htm"><b>with-output-to-ide-listener</b></a>
is handy for directing stream output to the currently selected IDE
listener window (though IDE Listener processes do that already).  It
finds the proper window and also has options for first moving to the
end of the text and for printing a fresh prompt or scrolling to the
top of the output after printing.

</li>
<li id="300">

<b>Building a distribution lets you overwrite an existing
subdirectory</b>.  The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a> command now
allows replacing an existing directory with the new distribution
directory as long as the specified directory is a subdirectory of the
project's default directory.  Replacing an existing directory had been
totally disallowed for safety reasons, but made it inconvenient to
reuse multiple distribution directories or to reuse a single
distribution directory after deleting the preferences file.

</li>
<li id="301">

<b>Build Project Distribution no longer does a purify by default</b>.
The <b>purify</b> option is no longer turned on by default for a
standalone application that is generated for a project, to remove the
additional .pll file from the distribution and avoid a possible
conflict with its positioning in memory at run time.

</li>
<li id="302">

<b>New widgets on the toolbar</b>.  The <b>Components Toolbar</b> has
new buttons for creating the new <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> and <a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> controls.  (It is more feasible to
develop a <a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> on a
form than it has been for the general <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>.)

</li>
<li id="303">

<b>A new menu of definitions in the current buffer</b>.  The new
editor keystroke Control-comma will show a menu of all definitions in
the buffer, and selecting one jumps to that definition.
Control-alt-comma does the same thing except also sorting the
definitions by their names.

</li>
<li id="304">

<b>A new function for finding IDE windows</b>.  The new function
<a href="operators/ide/find-ide-window.htm"><b>find-ide-window</b></a> may be called
to find an IDE window from its name.  This may be useful if you are
extending the IDE by operating on its windows programmatically.  This
function will work regardless of the value of the <a href="operators/ide/use-ide-parent-window.htm"><b>use-ide-parent-window</b></a> configuration option.  It
may especially be needed due to the incompatible change to <a href="operators/cg/f/find-window.htm"><b>find-window</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="305">

<b>Resizing grid sections on a form</b>. You can now interactively
resize <a href="classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a>
sections and subsections on a form window just as you would on the
running window.  (This is most useful with the new <a href="classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> control, which is
feasible to develop on a form.)

</li>
<li id="306">

<b>New keyboard shortcuts on a form window</b>.  You can now show a
form window's shortcut menu by pressing the spacebar (as an
alternative to right-clicking).  And you can deselect all selected
widgets by pressing the backspace key (which complements using the Tab
key to select successive widgets).

</li>
<li id="307">

<b>New icons in the Project Manager</b>.  The <b>Edit Dialog Form</b>
and <b>Edit Source Code</b> buttons in the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager</a> dialog
have new icons to make it easier to tell them apart.

</li>
<li id="308">

<b>Different keyboard shortcuts in the Project Manager</b>.  The
Project Manager's right-button shortcut menu has different keyboard
shortcuts that don't conflict with menu-bar accessors and that are
hopefully easier to remember.

</li>
<li id="309">

<b>Better default directory for adding a subproject</b>.  When using
the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a>'s <b>Add</b> button to add a subproject, the file
selection dialog now begins in the parent project's directory rather
than in the directory that was last used in the file dialog.

</li>
<li id="310">

<b>Project Manager buttons disabled when inapplicable</b>.  The
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project
Manager</a>'s toolbar buttons are now disabled when they are not
applicable to the currently selected tab or to the module that's
selected in the list of modules.

</li>
<li id="311">

<b>You can show the Project Manager's menu with the spacebar</b>.
When the keyboard focus is in the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager</a>'s list of
modules, you can now show its right-click shortcut menu by pressing
the spacebar.  Also, pressing the Enter key in this widget will
emulate the <b>View Selected Code</b> button in the toolbar.

</li>
<li id="312">

<b>The Options Dialog includes several addtional configuration options
and several have been removed</b>. The new and removed options on the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog.htm">Options</a> dialog
include <a href="operators/ide/query-os-exit.htm"><b>query-os-exit</b></a> and
<a href="operators/ide/ask-before-assuming-package.htm"><b>ask-before-assuming-package</b></a>
(a new one) on the IDE 1 tab, <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a> (titled <b>Show IDE Help
Within the IDE</b>) and <a href="operators/ide/move-ide-windows-on-screen-resize.htm"><b>move-ide-windows-on-screen-resize</b></a> (another new
one) on the IDE 2 tab, and <a href="operators/ide/project-parent-directory.htm"><b>project-parent-directory</b></a> on the Project tab.
<a href="operators/ide/scroll-while-tracing.htm"><b>scroll-while-tracing</b></a> has been
removed because it is on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/trace-dialog.htm">Trace Dialog</a>.  <a href="operators/ide/class-graph-initial-depth.htm"><b>class-graph-initial-depth</b></a> has been removed due
to obscurity.  There are still some options that are not on the
dialog, but they generally are either obscure or have other interfaces
in the IDE for controlling them.

</li>
<li id="313">

<b>Window positions and sizes are now remembered for each screen
resolution</b>.  The IDE's options file will now save a distinct set
of positions and sizes of the IDE tool windows for each different
screen resolution at which the IDE is run.  When first creating each
tool window after starting the IDE, it will be created at the position
and size that it had when the options file was last saved at the
current screen resolution, if any, and otherwise it will be created at
its default position and size.  In addition, the new <a href="operators/ide/move-ide-windows-on-screen-resize.htm"><b>move-ide-windows-on-screen-resize</b></a> configuration
option determines whether the IDE will automatically move and resize
its tool windows in this way when the screen resolution changes while
the IDE is running.  (This can happen, for example, when switching to
or from a Remote Desktop session or when attaching or removing an
auxilliary monitor.)  This option is enabled by default.

</li>
<li id="314">

<b>Interrupting reindentation in the editor</b>.  It is now possible
to interrupt the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/edit-menu.htm#reindent">Edit | Reindent</a> command by pressing the Escape
key.  (That command can take a while for a long form.)  The form may
be left partially reindented, though.

</li>
<li id="315">

<b>Newline added after pasting blocks of text</b>.  Pasting multiple
lines of text into the middle of line of text in a lisp-editor-pane
(such as an IDE editor pane) will insert a newline afterward
automatically.

</li>
<li id="316">

<b>An obscure directory dialog option</b>.  The new IDE configuration
option <a href="operators/ide/directory-dialog-searches-network-globally.htm"><b>directory-dialog-searches-network-globally</b></a>
determines the value that the IDE will pass for the
<i>search-network-globally</i> argument of <a href="operators/cg/a/ask-user-for-new-or-existing-directory.htm"><b>ask-user-for-new-or-existing-directory</b></a> whenever
an IDE command presents the directory-selecting dialog.  This value
may affect performance or which machines are listed.

</li>
<li id="317">

<b>A distinct options file for the Express version</b>.  The string
"-express" is now included in the options file name for the Express
release to distinguish it from an options file for a non-Express
product on the same machine.

</li>
<li id="318">

<b>Listener panes now list restarts</b>.  The IDE debugger will now
print the available restarts into the listener pane to match the
behavior of a non-IDE lisp.

</li>
<li id="319">

<b>A new function tells you where IDE preferences are saved</b>.  The
function <a href="operators/ide/options-path.htm"><b>ide:options-path</b></a>
returns the path to which the IDE would save its file of user
preferences.  The <i>user-specific</i> argument can be
passed as true or <code>nil</code> to find the path that
would be used for each value of the <a href="operators/ide/save-options-to-user-specific-file.htm"><b>save-options-to-user-specific-file</b></a> option.  The
default value of this argument is true (as is the default value of the
<a href="operators/ide/save-options-to-user-specific-file.htm"><b>save-options-to-user-specific-file</b></a> option).

</li>
<li id="320">

<b>The keyboard shortcut for Close Pane is more convenient</b>.  The
shortcut for the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#close-pane">File | Close Pane</a> command is now
control-alt-X instead of control-F4, because the latter is harder to
reach.  Control-F4 still works, though, because it's been added to the
IDE's global keyboard shortcuts for backward compatibility (and
because that keystroke is a semi-standard Windows keystroke).

</li>
<li id="321">

<b>More useful Enter key handling in the Trace Dialog</b>.  Pressing
the Enter key in the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/trace-dialog.htm">Trace Dialog</a> will now do something reasonable for
the widget that currently has the keyboard focus (generally whatever
double-clicking it does), instead of invoking whichever button widget
most recently had the focus.

</li>
<li id="322">

<b>Copying evaluated forms from the editor to the listener</b>.  When
using the numeric keypad Enter key (or the main Enter key with the Alt
key held down) to evalaute the form after the text cursor in the
editor, the evaluated form will now be copied to the IDE listener if
the control key is held down.  This helps to see the context of a
series of evaluated forms, though on the other hand it can clutter up
the listener when evaluating large forms.

</li>
<li id="323">

<b>No snapping to the grid when dragging widgets on a form window</b>.
The <a href="operators/ide/snap-to-grid.htm"><b>snap-to-grid</b></a> option of
form windows is now off by default because it makes it more difficult
to align widgets with each other rather than to the arbitrary grid.

</li>
<li id="324">

<b>Find In Files reports total matches</b>. The <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/find-in-files-dialog.htm">Find In Files</a> dialog
now reports the total number of matches found in all files (or editor
panes) that were searched.

</li>
<li id="325">

<b>A project can handle an on-initialization function in an unrelated
package</b>.  A package problem should no longer occur when opening or
loading a project if the .lpr project definition file contains a
symbol (such as the <a href="operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a> function) that's in a
non-built-in package that is also not the project's default package.

</li>
<li id="326">

<b>The autoload-warning property of a project is no longer on by
default</b>.  Autoload-warning is now <code>nil</code>
initially to match the <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> default and because it
causes a break if you do not have permission to write to the lisp
installation directory.  This doesn't affect the value for existing
projects.

</li>
<li id="327">

<b>define-project is now named by a common-graphics symbol</b>. In
earlier releases, define-project was named by an ide package symbol,
but for technical reasons the symbol has been moved to the
common-graphics package. See the description of <a href="operators/cg/d/define-project.htm"><b>define-project</b></a>.

<h3 id="331">
For complete information on the differences between Windows and GTK,
please see
<a href="cggtk-relnotes.html">cggtk-relnotes.html</a>.
</h3>

<p id="332">
Common Graphics and the IDE now run on Windows and Linux with
GTK. Certain differences between the two operating systems and
windowing systems mean that some things do not work the same in
Windows as in GTK and vice versa. The functionality listed here
tries to handle the differences. Some of the
variables/operators/etc. are only available on one of the two platforms.
</p>

<h3 id="333">
Known bug with menu-items and buttons
</h3>

<p id="334">
<b>GTK Only</b>: all-black menu-items and half-black buttons.  There
is still a mystery on the GTK platform where all button widgets can
turn half black along a diagonal line, and all menu-items on some
platforms will be totally black.  This seems to happen only when
opening a project from the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a> dialog, though, so a
workaround is to not reopen a project from that dialog and instead to
use the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/recent-menu.htm">Recent menu</a>
or <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#open-project">File | Open Project</a> just afterward.  We
have tracked the problem down to the use of transparent-pane windows
such as the frame-child of a form window, but beyond that it is a
total mystery.
</p>

<h4 id="335">
Mozilla support
</h4>

<p id="336">
The system needs to know the directory where the GTK control supplied
by Mozilla to support the <a href="classes/cg/html-widget.htm"><code>html-widget</code></a> resides. (On windows, the widget is
implemented in another way.) It may not be practical to search for the
location automatically. See <a href="operators/ide/mozilla-library-path.htm"><b>mozilla-library-path</b></a>, <a href="variables/excl/s_mozilla-library-path_s.htm"><code>*mozilla-library-path*</code></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/f/find-mozilla-gtk-path.htm"><b>find-mozilla-gtk-path</b></a>.
</p>

<h4 id="337">
Event handler processes
</h4>

<p id="338">
Because Linux currently does not use native threads and Windows does,
on Windows, all windows handle events in their own thread associated
with the window while on Linux/GTK, there is one event-handling
thread. <a href="operators/cg/d/default-application-window-subkey.htm"><b>default-application-window-subkey</b></a>, <a href="variables/cg/s_use-single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*use-single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a>, and
<a href="variables/cg/s_single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a> allow
distinguishing behavior when necessary. <a href="operators/cg/c/cg-process-wait.htm"><b>cg-process-wait</b></a> should be used on GTK instead of
<a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a> in event

<b>Linux has a built-in hand cursor</b>, which is the value of <a href="variables/cg/hand-cursor.htm"><code>hand-cursor</code></a>. That variable is
<code>nil</code> on windows. <code>(find-cursor

</li>
<li id="341">
<b>Linux pixel size issues</b>: because Linux/GTK seems not to have a
reliable notion of pixel size, the functions <a href="operators/cg/p/pixels-to-points.htm"><b>pixels-to-points</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/p/points-to-pixels.htm"><b>points-to-pixels</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/f/font-pixel-height.htm"><b>font-pixel-height</b></a> are provided.

<b>On GTK, the help commands use a third-party browser rather than a dialog

Instead, <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a>

true from an earlier release, you may wish to change it to <code>nil</code>.  If <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a> is true and the CG browser
fails, the IDE will automatically turn the option off for you, though
it's possible for the IDE to be hung at that point so that you cannot

<hr><h2 id="349"><a name="win-pack-2">8.6 Release notes for the winapi module</a></h2>

<p id="350">
The winapi module contains certain functions, in the windows package,
that perform OS-related tasks. See <a href="cgide.htm#nocg-winapp-1">The Windows API and a Windows API program with
windows but without CG</a> in <a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a> for
more information. The following changes were made in this module in
release 8.1.
</p>

<ol>
<li id="351">

<b>Some foreign functions in the winapi module have been changed from
:release-heap :when-ok to :release-heap :never</b>.  This was done
mostly for efficiency reasons, to avoid the overhead of releasing the
heap for functions that would clearly never call back into another
lisp process. There is a slight chance that one of these functions
actually will call back into another lisp process, leading to a
deadlock. This has not happened in our testing, and so we do not
expect it to be a problem. (See the
<b><i>release-heap</i></b> keyword argument to <a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a> for
information on releasing the heap.)

</li>
<li id="352">

<b>New global keyword argument for win:network-machines and
win:network-shares</b>. The functions <a href="operators/windows/network-machines.htm"><b>win:network-machines</b></a> and <a href="operators/windows/network-shares.htm"><b>win:network-shares</b></a> each have a new keyword
argument called
<b><i>global</i></b>.  When true, the entire network is
searched.  When <code>nil</code>, only the "current and
default network context" is searched.  In 7.0 and 8.0 these functions
always behaved as if <i>global</i> was true, but the
default has now been changed to <code>nil</code> to avoid
waiting on parts of the network that might have a significantly
delayed response.  To match the earlier behavior, you must pass this
argument explicitly as true.

</li>
<li id="353">

<b>New return-tree keyword argument to win:network-machines</b>. The
function <a href="operators/windows/network-machines.htm"><b>win:network-machines</b></a>
has a new <b><i>return-tree</i></b> keyword argument.
When this argument is true and the new <i>global</i>
keyword argument is true (see above), the returned list will be a tree
structure similar to the <b>My Network Places</b> tree in the Windows
File Manager.  When <code>nil</code> (the default), a
simple list of all machines will be returned as before.

</li>
<li id="354">

<b>New allowed value for <i>machines</i> argument to
win:network-shares</b>. The value of the required
<i>machine</i> argument to <a href="operators/windows/network-shares.htm"><b>win:network-shares</b></a> has an additional

returning the set of all networked machines and their shares as a tree
rather than a list (when the new <i>global</i> argument
(see above) is true.

<b>Behavior of win:network-machines and win:network-shares when there
is an error</b>. If an unknown error occurs in <a href="operators/windows/network-machines.htm"><b>win:network-machines</b></a> or <a href="operators/windows/network-shares.htm"><b>win:network-shares</b></a> while trying to access a
particular machine, then the symbol <code>:unknown-error</code>
will be returned rather than signaling an error.  (For <a href="operators/windows/network-shares.htm"><b>win:network-shares</b></a>, this symbol
would replace the list of shares for a particular machine in the
returned list.)  This is similar to returning
<code>:access-denied</code> when a machine does not allow
access.

<p id="359">
CLX (Common Lisp X) provides an interface between Common Lisp and the
X window system. All versions of Allegro CL include a compiled
version of CLX with the distribution. The <i>fasl</i>
file is <i>code/clx.fasl</i>, loaded by evaluating
<code>(require :clx)</code>. The Allegro CL products CLIM and
Allegro Composer use CLX. Users wanting low-level access to an X
server in Lisp may also want to use CLX.  CLX is not supported by
Franz Inc.
</p>
<p id="360">
The sources to CLX are supplied with the regular Allegro CL
distributions in the <i>contrib/clx/</i> directory. Note
that during installation, you are asked whether you wish to install
the <i>contrib/</i> directory and the default is not to
install it. The <i>contrib/</i> directory is not
included in the Trial distribution, but Trial users can download the
CLX sources from the Franz Inc. website as described next.
</p>
<p id="361">
The sources to CLX are also available on the Franz Inc. web site (<a href="http://www.franz.com/">www.franz.com</a>), at the location <a href="ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/clx/">ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/clx/</a>.
