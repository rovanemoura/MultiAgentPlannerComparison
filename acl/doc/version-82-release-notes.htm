<p id="6">
This document provides the release notes for
release 8.2 of Allegro Common Lisp and related products. Many
sections are divided into non-backward-compatible changes (that
produce different behavior in release 8.2
compared to release 
8.1) and changes
unrelated to backward-compatibility. Note that a bug fix is <i>not</i>
considered a backward-incompatible change even if it does result in
changed behavior because the previous behavior was erroneous.

<h3 id="15">
Major update to AllegroServe
</h3>

<p id="16">
A new version of AllegroServe, version 1.3.1, has been released. It is
available from github
(<a href="http://github.com/franzinc/aserve/">http://github.com/franzinc/aserve/</a>)
or as a patch for Allegrop CL 8.2. Of particular importance are
automatic compression and inflation of files, chunking support, and
new choices for security, including the TLS v1.0 (also called SSL
v3.1) protocol for secure
communications. See <a href="aserve/aserve.html">aserve/aserve.html</a>,
which is the AllegroServe documentation.
</p>
<p id="17">
The changes include:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="18">
<b>New compression and chunking support on
AllegroServe</b>. AllegroServe can now compress responses on the fly
if requested.  Aserve's client code can request a compressed transfer
and can uncompress the result. Further, In the past AllegoServe
disabled chunking for an SSL server and told users to use the http/1.0
protocol for clients when SSL was being used.  Now those restrictions
are gone.  The default for the server will be to use chunking in all
cases and clients can specify http/1.1 for requests over SSL. See
documentation
(<a href="aserve/aserve.html">aserve/aserve.html</a>) for
API changes related to these new features.
</li>
<li id="19">
<b>Security options</b>. <b>net.aserve:start</b> and
<b>net.aserve.client:do-http-request</b> have a :ssl-method keyword
argument which can be used to specify v2.0, v3.0 or TLS v1.0 (SSL
v3.1) communication protocols. Specifying :tslv1 means that you only
want to communicate using TLS v1.0 (SSL v3.1), the most modern and
secure of the protocols.
</li>
<li id="20">
<b>Delay sending headers for computed entities</b>. Errors can occur
when running the computed entity function.  When an error occurs one
would like to send back a different response such as '500 - Internal
Server Error'.  In order to make this possible the http response code
and the headers that follow that are not immediately sent back to the
server when <b>with-http-body</b> starts.  Instead they are held in
request-reply-stream and are only sent when the computed entity
function sends data to the stream.  Thus if you do computation before
sending any data you can avoid having any response sent to the client
until the computation finishes.
</li>
<li id="21">
<b>publish-directory can accept a list of destinations</b>.  When a
request comes in <b>publish-directory</b> will search one or more
directories for the requested file.
</li>
<li id="22">
<b>Other AllegroServe changes</b>. (1) The :keep-alive arguement
to <b>do-http-request</b> will now cause <b>do-http-request</b> to
return a fifth value: a socket connected to the server. That fifth
value will be <code>nil</code> if the server refuses to
keep the connection with the client open.  Even if the server agrees
to keeps the connection alive it will close it after some period of
inactivity. (2) <b>do-http-request</b> takes a :connection argument
which is how the socket returned by <b>do-http-request</b> should be
passed to the next <b>do-http-request</b> call.  It is ok if the value
of the :connection argument is <code>nil</code> or closed
socket.  <b>do-http-request</b> will notice that the socket is
unusable and will create a new one. See documentation
(<a href="aserve/aserve.html">aserve/aserve.html</a>).
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="23">
jLinker revision patch removed
</h3>

<p id="24">
A jLinker patch released in April, 2011, has been withdrawn. If you
downloaded the patch, doing a further update will revoke it. It was
decided that the changes could not be accomodated in deployed
applications. The changes will be re-introduced in release 9.0.
</p>
<p id="25">
We have further revised <a href="jlinker.htm">jlinker.htm</a> and the
documentation of <a href="operators/jlinker/jlinker-init.htm"><b>jlinker-init</b></a> in light of removing
the patch.
</p>

<h3 id="26">
Major changes to the Allegro CL interface to the Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), some incompatible
</h3>

<p id="27">
The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), described
in <a href="ec2.htm">ec2.htm</a> has had a major revision, with support
now provided for regions. The changes are described at the beginning
of <a href="ec2.htm">ec2.htm</a>. Note that some changes are
incompatible: some argument lists have changed, a number of variables
have been removed, defaults for some arguments are changed, and so
on. There is also much new functionality.
</p>

<h3 id="28">
Other changes since the release
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="29">
<b>New installation for Mac 64-bit graphics utilities</b>. You need
GTK and X11 to use the IDE or CLIM with Allegro CL on the Mac, and
additionally OpenMotif for CLIM. Previously, installation of these
utilities for 64-bit Lisps was very involved and difficult. This
process has been simplified substantially, as described
in <a href="installation.htm#macosx-x11-2">Installing X11,
GTK, and Open Motif on Mac OS X</a>
in <a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="30">
<b>dequeue method can now wait with a timeout</b>. The wait keyword argument to
<a href="operators/mp/dequeue.htm"><b>dequeue</b></a> can now be a real
number, indicating how many seconds a process should wait when asked
to dequeue an empty queue (waiting for an item to be added to the
queue so it can be dequeued). If the time limit is reached, the value
of the new <i>empty-queue-result</i> argument is
returned. If <i>wait</i> is <code>nil</code>
and the queue is empty, an error is returned (as
before). If <i>wait</i> is a real less than or equal to
zero and the queue is empty, <a href="operators/mp/dequeue.htm"><b>dequeue</b></a> returns the value of the
<i>empty-queue-result</i> immediately.
</li>
<li id="31">
<b>Deflation (compression) of data now supported</b>. The class
<a href="miscellaneous.htm#deflate-stream-class-bookmarkxx"><code>util.zip:deflate-stream</code></a> and
related functions allow you to compress data which can then be written
to a file or to a vector. The existing function
<a href="miscellaneous.htm#inflate-op-bookmarkxx"><b>util.zip:inflate</b></a> will uncompress
the data. The deflate utility was added in a patch released in March,
2011.
</li>
<li id="32">
<b>The macro in-case-mode, designed to assit loading fasl file
compiled in one case mode into a Lisp using another case
mode</b>. While it is always better to use source files and associated
fasl files compiled in the case mode you are using in your running
Lisp (see <a href="case.htm">case.htm</a>), sometimes this is not
possible. The new macro <a href="operators/excl/in-case-mode.htm"><b>in-case-mode</b></a> will permit loading fasl
files compiled in a different mode from the ruinning Lisp in most
cases.
</li>
<li id="33">
<b>Structures may be passed and returned to foreign functions by value
as well as by reference</b>. See <a href="foreign-functions.htm#structs-by-value-1">Passing structures by value</a>
in <a href="foreign-functions.htm">foreign-functions.htm</a> for more
information. Until this change, all structures were passed and
returned by reference, even when the specification indicated (because
no *) that by value was desired. Because of this change, existing code
that seems to specify by value will signal a warning but will still be
converted to by reference. You must modify the code (specifying a
value for the <i>pass-structs-by-value</i> argument
to <a href="operators/ff/def-foreign-call.htm"><b>def-foreign-call</b></a>) or set
the value of <a href="variables/ff/s_pass-structs-by-value_s.htm"><code>ff:*pass-structs-by-value*</code></a> appropriately to get
by value behavior.
</li>
</ul>

<hr><hr><h2 id="34"><a name="fasl-incompat-1">3.0 Fasl files are not-compatible between versions and operating systems</a></h2>



<hr><h2 id="35"><a name="version-fasl-incompat-2">3.1 All pre-8.2 Lisp compiled files must be recompiled (old fasl files will not load)</a></h2>

<p id="36">
<i>fasl</i> files (compiled Lisp files) created by
releases of Allegro CL prior to 8.2 
will not load into Allegro CL 8.2. All such files must be recreated by
compiling the associated Lisp source files. An error will be signaled
if Lisp attempts to load an older, incompatible
<i>fasl</i> file.
</p>
<p id="37">
8.2.beta fasl file will load into 8.2 final. There is no need to
recompile 8.2.beta compiled files.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="38"><a name="os-fasl-incompat-2">3.2 Fasl files may be incompatible in different Lisps on same hardware</a></h2>

<h3 id="39">
Fasl files created on Windows x86 cannot be loaded into Linux or
FreeBSD x86 Lisps
</h3>

<p id="40">
The Windows and UNIX operating systems are too different. However,
FASL files (for the same Lisp version) can generally be shared between
different UNIX operating systems on the same hardware. The general
principles are as follows. Note that incompatibility may creep in for
reasons outside our control. If fasl files are incompatible, recompile
on the target machine.
</p>
<h3 id="41">
Fasl files will usually be compatible between platforms when:
</h3>
<ul>
<li id="42">
the architecture (hardware) is the same
</li>
<li id="43">
the calling convention is the same (that is, the method of calling
functions and the registers they use for arguments are the same)
</li>
<li id="44">
the method for generating signals can be made compatible (this cannot
be done for Windows and UNIX, so they are incompatible for this
reason)
</li>
</ul>
<p id="45">
It is up to the user to ensure that there are no os-specific
dependencies, or that features (i.e. #+/#- ) did not cause
essential code to be excluded or extraneous code introduced
that would cause a problem on the crossed architecture.
</p>



<hr><hr><h2 id="46"><a name="install-1">4.0 Release Notes for installation</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="47">

<b>Except for Mac OS X, version 8.2 uses the 8.1 installation
procedure</b>:

installation is described in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>. 
Mac OS X installation is
described in the section Installation on Mac OS X in
<a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="48">
<b>The distribution includes 8 bit and 16 bit character images</b>
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). Allegro CL
has images that support 8 bit characters only, or 16 bit
characters only. It is our expectation that most users will use the 16
bit images. Executables supplied with the distribution either have or
do not have `8' in the name. Those with 8 in the name (mlisp8 and
alisp8, e.g.) support 8 bit characters. Those without a number in the
name support 16 bit characters. Image (dxl) files also come in 8 and
16 varieties. Again, 8 in the name means 8 bit character
support. Character support for images and executables must
match. Trying to start an executable with the wrong type of image
fails.
</li>

<li id="49">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro Composer images in the distribution</b> 
(this information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To
create an Allegro Composer image, start Allegro CL and load
<em>buildcomposer.cl</em>. That will produce <em>composer</em> and
<em>composer.dxl</em>, or <em>composer8</em> and
<em>composer8.dxl</em>. Allegro Composer is available on Unix only.
</li>

<li id="50">
<b>No prebuilt Allegro CLIM images in the distribution</b> (this
information is repeated from earlier Release Notes). To create a CLIM
image, start Allegro CL and load <em>buildclim.cl</em>. That will
produce <em>clim</em> and <em>clim.dxl</em>, or <em>clim8</em> and
<em>clim8.dxl</em>.

<p id="69">
A problem with Solaris 2.8 where calls to <a href="operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm"><b>run-shell-command</b></a> can cause Lisp to hang is
fixed by operating system patch 108993-18 (which supersedes the
earlier patch 108827-36 for this problem). On Solaris 8, it can
also be fixed by adding <b>/usr/lib/lwp</b> to the front of your

<hr><h2 id="77"><a name="aix-2">5.3 AIX notes</a></h2>

<p id="78">
In order for Allegro CL 8.2 to run on AIX the following filesets must

These filesets should be available on the AIX installation media.
</p>
<p id="82">
Without these filesets, Lisp will likely fail on startup. The exact
nature of the failure depends of the specific <b>dlopen()</b>
implementation. A typical failure message looks like:

<hr><hr><h2 id="86"><a name="acl-1">6.0 Release Notes for the base Lisp</a></h2>

<p id="87">
This main section contains three subsections (which have additional
subsections): one on new features
(<a href="#acl-new">Section 6.1 New features in the base Lisp</a>), one on changes which are not
backwards compatible and so may require code changes,
(<a href="#acl-non-back-2">Section 6.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in the base Lisp</a>), and one on
miscellaneous changes (<a href="#acl-other-2">Section 6.3 Other changes to and notes about the base Lisp</a>).
</p>


<hr><h2 id="88"><a name="acl-new">6.1 New features in the base Lisp</a></h2>

<p id="89">
We have added a number of new capabilities to Allegro CL. Here we give
links to the documentation of the new features.
</p>
<p id="90">
The features described in
<a href="#acl-added-in-81">Section 6.1.1 Features added to Allegro CL 8.1 after the initial release of Allegro CL 8.1</a> were released
originally as patches to Allegro CL 8.1, but after the initial release
of Allegro CL 8.1. The features described in
<a href="#acl-new-in-82-3">Section 6.1.2 New features in Allegro CL 8.2</a> are new in the Allegro CL
8.2 release.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="91"><a name="acl-added-in-81">6.1.1 Features added to Allegro CL 8.1 after the initial release of Allegro CL 8.1</a></h2>


<p id="92">
Various additions to Allegro CL 8.1 were added after the original
release of Allegro CL 8.1. We list them here. All are part of release
8.2.
</p>


<ol>
<li id="93">
<b>Changes to multiprocessing API in anticipation of Symmetric
Multiprocessing (SMP).</b> SMP will be introduced to Allegro CL in
release 9.0. In SMP, the macros <a href="operators/excl/without-interrupts.htm"><b>without-interrupts</b></a> and <a href="operators/system/without-scheduling.htm"><b>sys:without-scheduling</b></a> will no longer lock
objects in code they enclose (this is a side effect of preventing
process switches in a non-SMP Lisp). Therefore, code which depends on
that feature must be rewritten. The
document <a href="smp.htm">smp.htm</a> describes the changes and the new
functionality that implements the new API. Because 8.2 does not
implement SMP, code will run as before but we recommend that users
modify their code now in anticipation. There is one noticeable change:
when the compiler encounters <a href="operators/excl/without-interrupts.htm"><b>without-interrupts</b></a> or <a href="operators/system/without-scheduling.htm"><b>sys:without-scheduling</b></a>, a warning will be
signaled syaing that these macros are now deprecated. This warning can
be muffled by evaluating <code>(setq excl::warn-smp-usage
nil)</code>.
</li>
<li id="94">
<b>New plot widget for drawing X/Y graphs (such as scatter
graphs)</b>. An analog of the existing <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a>, the new <b><a href="classes/cg/plot-widget.htm"><code>plot-widget</code></a></b> allows drawing X/Y plots of
various types. The <a href="classes/cg/plot-widget.htm"><code>plot-widget</code></a> page has several examples. There are
new functions and many <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> operators and classes have been
modified to encompass the new plot functionality. (The biggest change
is where methods are defined, with methods previously defined on a
class now being inherited from a superclass.)
Existing <a href="classes/cg/chart-widget.htm"><code>chart-widget</code></a> code
should work without change. 
</li>
<li id="95">
<b>Enhancements to IDE projects allows easier handling of
subprojects</b>:
see <a href="cg/ide-ug/ide_user_guide_4.htm#sec-4-6-1">Section 4.6.1
Subprojects</a> in the IDE User Guide.
</li>
<li id="96">
<b>Enhancements to the mail functions send-smtp, send-smtp-auth and
send-letter to support SSL and STARTTLS</b>. The mail
functions <a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp.htm"><b>send-smtp</b></a>, <a href="operators/post-office/send-smtp-auth.htm"><b>send-smtp-auth</b></a>,
and <a href="operators/post-office/send-letter.htm"><b>send-letter</b></a>
have all been been enhanced to allow for ssl connections and STARTTLS
negotiation ('TLS' stands for Transport Layer Security and is another
name for SSL.) The enhancement is implemented by allowing information
to be included in the value of
the <i>mail-server</i>. See the (linked) function
descriptions for details.
</li>
<li id="97">
<b>Changes to SSL interface allows using more methods and using
ciphers</b>. The <b><i>methods</i></b> keyword argument
to <a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a> and
<a href="operators/socket/make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>
now accepts more options allowing more control over which SSL protocol
is used. A new ciphers keyword argument allows using a cipher.
</li>
<li id="98">
<b>Enhanced update.exe on Windows now also downloads
updates</b>. <b>update.exe</b> is the program on Windows that rebuilds
images when you have obtained updates using <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> (or
the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/download-dialog.htm">Download
Patches</a> dialog). <b>update.exe</b> has been enhanced to
accept arguments: <b>-u</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-P</b>. When <b>-u</b>
is passed, updates will be downloaded and new images built if
necessary. <b>-p</b> and <b>-P</b> specify how
<a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> (which
is called when <b>-u</b> is specified) will deal with proxies. See the
description of <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> for details.
</li>
<li id="99">
<b>New unix-shared-library examples and documentation</b>. The
description of how to make a Lisp application a shared library on
Unix-style platforms is now applicable to all such
platforms. See <a href="unix-shared-library.htm">unix-shared-library.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="100">
<b>New util-string module and util.string:string+ function</b>. The
module is designed to provide string utility functions that are more
efficient or more convenient that Common Lisp string functions. The
first new function is <a href="string-utilities.htm#string+-op-bookmarkxx"><b>string+</b></a>. It acts like
<code>(concatenate 'string ...)</code> but accepts any objects
as arguments (stringifying them with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-to.htm"><b>princ-to-string</b></a>) and like
<code>(format nil "..."  ...)</code> but is faster, particularly
for short strings and certain common object types, and easier to
use. See <a href="string-utilities.htm">string-utilities.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="101">
<b>New operating system interface function excl.osi:mkdtemp creates a
uniquely named temporary directory</b>. This new function does not
work on Windows, Solaris, or HP-UX. <a href="os-interface.htm#mkdtemp-op-bookmarkxx"><b>excl.osi:mkdtemp</b></a> takes a string
ending in six X's (like "/tmp/mydirXXXXXX") as its argument. It
replaces the six X's with characters that result in a new directory
name, creates the directory, and returns the new name (a string). 
</li>
<li id="102">
<b>New compact keyword argument to
net.mail:extract-email-addresses</b>.
<a href="imap.htm#extract-email-addresses-op-bookmarkxx"><b>extract-email-addresses</b></a> now accepts
a <i>compact</i> keyword argument, which, when specified
true, causes the results to be returned as a list
of <code>user@domain</code> strings.
</li>
<li id="103">
<b>excl.shell:rm has a new no-execute keyword argument</b>. Like the
<i>no-execute</i> argument to other shell functions,
when specified true, information about what would be done is printed
but no further action is taken. See <a href="shell-module.htm#rm-op-bookmarkxx"><b>rm</b></a> and
<a href="shell-module.htm">shell-module.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="104">
<b>defun-foreign-callable now accepts a returning
declaration</b>. <a href="operators/ff/defun-foreign-callable.htm"><b>defun-foreign-callable</b></a> accepts "declarations"
which provide information about the foreign-callable Lisp function. A
<code>:returning</code> declaration is now accepted. Its value
can be a foreign type. The <code>:returning</code> declaration
replaces the <i>convert-to-c-types</i> argument in
<a href="operators/ff/register-foreign-callable.htm"><b>register-foreign-callable</b></a> when
it is used.
</li>
<li id="105">
<b>md5-file has a return keyword argument</b>. The documentation
for <a href="operators/excl/md5-file.htm"><b>md5-file</b></a> did not
describe it but has been corrected.
</li>
</ol>








<hr><h2 id="106"><a name="acl-new-in-82-3">6.1.2 New features in Allegro CL 8.2</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="107">
<b>New step interface will step through sources</b>. The documentation is at
<a href="debugging.htm#source-step-1">The source
stepper</a> in <a href="debugging.htm">debugging.htm</a>. See also the
new <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper
Dialog</a>.  Note it is not available on Sparc or AIX platforms.
</li>
<li id="108">
<b>describe for a function-object now lists closed over variables if
any</b>. Here is an example using <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/describe.htm"><b>describe</b></a>:
<pre id="109">
cl-user(1): (let (x) (defun foo (y) (+ x y)))
foo
cl-user(2): (describe #'foo)
#&lt;Interpreted Closure foo&gt; is a new function.
  The arguments are (y)
It closes over the following variables:
x
cl-user(3): 
</pre>
</li>
<li id="110">
<b>Type and dynamic-extent declarations warn about non-visible
variables</b>. If a type or a dynamic-extent declaration references a
variable or an ftype declaration references a function that is not
lexically visible, a warning is signaled. Thus:
<pre id="111">
(defun show-me (msg &rest args)
  (declare (dynamic-extent blargs))
  (apply #'format t msg args))
</pre>

<p id="112">
will signal a warning.
</p>
</li>
<li id="113">
<b>New coverage tool excl:with-coverage</b>. Coverage analysis
determines how much code has been excercised in a test. A new
macro, <a href="operators/excl/with-coverage.htm"><b>with-coverage</b></a>,
provides coverage information on tested
code. See <a href="miscellaneous.htm#coverage-1">Coverage
analysis in Allegro CL</a>
in <a href="miscellaneous.htm">miscellaneous.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="114">
<b>New start and end keyword arguments to disassemble</b>: the
function cl:disassemble not accepts start and end keyword arguments
which restrict the output to a portion of the disassembled code. See <a href="implementation.htm#extensions-to-clfuns-one-2">Extensions to cl:make-package, 
cl:disassemble, cl:truename, cl:probe-file, cl:open, 
cl:apropos</a> in 
<a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="115">
<b>New functions test for floating-point Nans and infinities</b>. The
functions <a href="operators/excl/exceptional-floating-point-number-p.htm"><b>exceptional-floating-point-number-p</b></a>,
<a href="operators/excl/nanp.htm"><b>nanp</b></a>,
and <a href="operators/excl/infinityp.htm"><b>infinityp</b></a> test
whether an object is a floating-point infinity or NaN. The constants
associated with floating-point infinities and NaNs were exported in an
update to release 8.1. See <a href="implementation.htm#infinities-nans-2">Floating-point infinities and NaNs, and
floating-point underflow and overflow</a>
in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>.

</li>
<li id="116">
<b>New cl:time implementation provides more detailed
information</b>. The <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/time.htm"><b>cl:time</b></a> macro prints information on the
time taken and the space used when evaluating a
form. <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/time.htm"><b>cl:time</b></a> has
been modified to display time in microseconds rather than
milleseconds:
<pre id="117">
cl-user(1): (time (dotimes (i 100000000) (* i i)))
; cpu time (non-gc) 7.478883 sec user, 0.137910 sec system
; cpu time (gc)     5.481388 sec user, 0.093007 sec system
; cpu time (total)  12.960271 sec user, 0.230917 sec system
; real time  13.215964 sec
; space allocation:
;  0 cons cells, 2,399,443,896 other bytes, 0 static bytes
nil
cl-user(2): 
</pre>

</li>
<li id="118">
<b>Function print-system-state now returns no values</b>. In earlier
releases, <a href="operators/excl/print-system-state.htm"><b>print-system-state</b></a>
returned <code>nil</code>.
</li>
<li id="119">
<b>Minor changes to gc information printed after a garbage
collection</b>. The brief message after a scavenge now looks like
this: <code>gc: XN-E=32% N=444528 T+=0 A-=0 pfu=0+336
pfg=0+11</code> rather than this: <code>gc: XN-E=32% N=444528
O+=0 pfu=0+336 pfg=0+11</code>. T+ (meaning bytes tenured to
oldspace) is used instead of O+, and A- (meaning <a href="operators/excl/aclfree.htm"><b>aclfree</b></a> bytes freed) has been
added. Similar changes have been made to the more verbose
messages. These messages are discussed in the
section <a href="gc.htm#gsgc-switches-2">Gsgc
switches</a> and the section <a href="gc.htm#finding-out-when-scavenge-happens-2">How do I find out when
scavenges happen?</a> in <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="120">
<b>excl:aclfree and excl:aclfree-aligned now return number of bytes
originally requested or 0</b>. The number of bytes freed is greater
than or equal to the value returned, unless that value is 0, which
normally means no action was taken for some reason (but it is more
complicated, so see the page descriptions). See <a href="operators/excl/aclfree.htm"><b>aclfree</b></a> and <a href="operators/excl/aclfree-aligned.htm"><b>aclfree-aligned</b></a> for further details.
</li>
<li id="121">
<b>Scavenges may be triggered by aclmalloc calls</b>. Malloc space may
be freed as a side effect of a scavenge (a garbage collection of
newspace, see <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a>). Now a scavenge may be
triggered by the need for aclmalloc space even if newspace is not
full. See <a href="gc.htm#when-scavenges-2">When scavenges
occur</a> in <a href="gc.htm">gc.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="122">
<b>New optional environment argument to
excl:arglist</b>: <a href="operators/excl/arglist.htm"><b>arglist</b></a> now takes an optional
environment argument. If specified and non-nil, it must be an
environment object which is used to find the current lexical
definition of the function within that environment rather than looking
for the global definition.
</li>
<li id="123">
<b>New compiler switch verify-type-declarations-switch gives runtime
check for declared variables</b>. Code compiled
while <a href="variables/compiler/verify-type-declarations-switch.htm"><code>verify-type-declarations-switch</code></a> is true
will have runtime checks added to ensure declared variables which are
set, or let or lambda bound have a value of the correct type. See the
description of <a href="variables/compiler/verify-type-declarations-switch.htm"><code>verify-type-declarations-switch</code></a> for
details and restrictions.
</li>
<li id="124">
<b>New file-version-info argument to generate-application (Windows
only)</b>: <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> takes a
<b><i>file-version-info</i></b> keyword argument which
takes a list of keyword/string pairs and these are stored as
VERSIONINFO in the application
executable. See <a href="delivery.htm#version-info-3">Setting the VERSIONINFO of the application
executable on Windows</a> in <a href="delivery.htm">delivery.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="125">
<b>New compiler optimization switches optimize-large-functions-switch,
save-source-level-debug-info-switch, and
generate-accurate-x86-float-code-switch</b>. <a href="variables/compiler/optimize-large-functions-switch.htm"><code>optimize-large-functions-switch</code></a> allows you
to suppress optizations when they result in too large a compiled
function and associated too long compilation
speed. <a href="variables/compiler/save-source-level-debug-info-switch.htm"><code>save-source-level-debug-info-switch</code></a> tells
the compiler to write information useful for source debugging and
coverage analysis to the fasl file. <a href="variables/compiler/generate-accurate-x86-float-code-switch.htm"><code>generate-accurate-x86-float-code-switch</code></a>
only affects 32-bit x86. If true (as it is except when speed is 3 and
safety 0), flags are set which ensures the results floating-point
calculations are identical from run to run;
if <code>nil</code> such calculations are faster but may
differ in the lowest bits from run to run.
</li>
<li id="126">
<b>:follow can be the value of Allegro CL print variables</b>. The
value means use the value of the corresponding CL print
variable. See <a href="implementation.htm#print-follow-2">Allegro CL print variables can follow the CL
print variable value</a>
in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="127">
<b>New trace print variables *trace-print-array* and
*trace-print-circle*</b>. See <a href="variables/excl/s_trace-print-array_s.htm"><code>*trace-print-array*</code></a>
and <a href="variables/excl/s_trace-print-circle_s.htm"><code>*trace-print-circle*</code></a>.
</li>
<li id="128">
<b>New trace option :show-stack</b>. See <a href="debugging.htm#tracer-1">The tracer</a>
in <a href="debugging.htm">debugging.htm</a>.
</li>
<li id="129">
<b>New macro ensuring-compiled-body and associated function
compile-lambda-expr-in-env</b>. <a href="operators/excl/ensuring-compiled-body.htm"><b>ensuring-compiled-body</b></a> is
like <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/progn.htm"><b>progn</b></a> in that it executes
its body forms sequentially, but if encountered in interpreted code, it
wraps the body in a <code>lambda</code> and passes it to
<a href="operators/excl/compile-lambda-expr-in-env.htm"><b>compile-lambda-expr-in-env</b></a> for
compilation and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/funcall.htm"><b>funcall</b></a>s the
result. Thus the code will be executed compiled in all cases. The
associated <a href="operators/excl/compile-lambda-expr-in-env.htm"><b>compile-lambda-expr-in-env</b></a> takes a lambda
expression and an environment, and compiles the lambda expression and
returns the resulting function object.
</li>
<li id="130">
<b>New URI slot accessor net.uri:uri-userinfo</b>. <a href="operators/uri/uri-userinfo.htm"><b>uri-userinfo</b></a> accesses the userinfo slot
of a <a href="classes/uri/uri.htm"><code>uri</code></a> object.
</li>
</ol>






<hr><h2 id="131"><a name="acl-non-back-2">6.2 Non-backward-compatible changes in the base Lisp</a></h2>

<ol>
<li id="132">
<b>Windows only: new Open SSL version</b>: Allegro CL Enterprise and
above uses a different version of Open SSL for the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) protocol, as described in
<a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>. On Unix platforms,
the libraries are part of the Allegro CL library so Unix customers
need not make any changes. Windows customers must install the new
version, as described in <a href="installation.htm#install-openssl-1">Installing OpenSSL libraries on
Windows</a> in <a href="installation.htm">installation.htm</a>. The
directory used is different so previous installations are unaffected.
</li>
<li id="133">
<b>named-readtable now errors by default when there is no readtable
with specified name</b>. The default value of the
optional <b><i>errorp</i></b> argument to
<a href="operators/excl/named-readtable.htm"><b>named-readtable</b></a> is
now <code>t</code> rather
than <code>nil</code>, so <code>(named-readtable
:no-such-name)</code> errors rather than
returning <code>nil</code> while <code>(named-readtable
:no-such-name nil)</code> returns <code>nil</code>. The
change was made because <code>(setq *readtable* (named-readtable
:my-misspelled-name))</code> would result
in <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> being
<code>nil</code>, with bad consequences perhaps hard to
debug. You might have code like this:
<pre id="134">
(let ((rt (or (excl:named-readtable :myrt)
              (setf (excl:named-readtable :myrt) (copy-readtable)))))
  ...)
</pre>
<p id="135">
That code will error if the :myrt readtable does not exist. This is the fix:
</p>
<pre id="136">
(let ((rt (or (excl:named-readtable :myrt nil) ;; errorp is now NIL
              (setf (excl:named-readtable :myrt) (copy-readtable)))))
  ...)
</pre>
</li>
<li id="137">
<b>Compiler optimization switch functions now have five (rather than
four) required arguments as compilation-speed quality is now
used</b>. The compiler optimization switches are variables such
as <a href="variables/compiler/trust-declarations-switch.htm"><code>trust-declarations-switch</code></a>. They are all
listed in <a href="compiling.htm#current-settings-2">Examining the current settings and their
effect</a> in <a href="compiling.htm">compiling.htm</a>. Their value must
be t, nil, or a function of five required arguments. The arguments are
the values of the optization qualities <b>saftey</b>, <b>space</b>,
<b>speed</b>, <b>debug</b>, and <b>compilation-speed</b>. In previous
releases, <b>compilation-speed</b> was not used and the functions took
four required arguments.
<p id="138">
This change affects only those users who wrote their own functions to
be the value of the swicthes. It is possible even those functions will
continue to work, depending on how the argument list was specified and
how the function was compiled, but users are urged to update any
functions they wrote.
</p>
<p id="139">
<b>compilation-speed</b> is initially only used
for <a href="variables/compiler/optimize-large-functions-switch.htm"><code>optimize-large-functions-switch</code></a>.
</p>
<p id="140">
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>
(see <a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>) now has a
<code>:opt-compilation-speed</code> keyword argument, similar to
the
existing <code>:opt-debug</code>, <code>:opt-space</code>,
<code>:opt-speed</code>, and <code>:opt-safety</code>
keyword arguments, setting the initial value of the quality in the
image being built.
</p>
</li>
<li id="141">
<b>Standard readtable is now read-only</b>. The standard readtable,
which is the initial value of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> when Lisp starts, is now read-only
and cannot be modified. Copies of that readtable can be
modified. See <a href="implementation.htm#readtable-2">The
standard readtable is read-only, affect on with-standard-io-syntax and
modifying the readtable in init files</a>
in <a href="implementation.htm">implementation.htm</a> for more information. As the
title of that section implies, we believe the most likely effect of
this change is to break calls to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/with-sta.htm"><b>with-standard-io-syntax</b></a> where the body modified
the value of <code>*readtable*</code> (which is set to the
standard readtable by the macro), and cause error when forms in an
init file (like .clinit.cl) modify <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/readtabl.htm"><code>*readtable*</code></a> because its value during
initialization is the standard readtable. (In a listener, it is by
default a copy of the standard readtable). We show how to get around
those problems in the linked section.
</li>
<li id="142">
<b>build-lisp-image/generate-application argument name changes:
:c-heap-start and :c-heap-size are now :aclmalloc-heap-start and
:aclmalloc-heap-size. The names of the associated environment
variables have also changed from ACL_BUILD_C_HEAP_START and
ACL_BUILD_C_HEAP_SIZE to ACL_BUILD_ACLMALLOC_HEAP_START and
ACL_BUILD_ACLMALLOC_HEAP_SIZE</b>. The arguments to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> which specify the start and
initial size of the Aclmalloc heap (formerly called the C heap) are
now <b><code>:aclmalloc-heap-start</code></b> (formerly
<code>:c-heap-start</code>)
and <b><code>:aclmalloc-heap-size</code></b> (formerly
<code>:c-heap-size</code>). The new names more accurately
describe the heap and its use (it is the heap allocated for space
needed by aclmalloc and certain static arrays and related things). It
has nothing to do with C. <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> also uses the new
argument names, which are simply passed to
<a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a>. The heap
is now refered to in the documentation as the Aclmalloc heap rather
than as the C heap.
<p id="143">
The old argument names (:c-heap-size and :c-heap-start) are still
accepted but their use signals a warning. The old environment variable
names and also accepted (the environment variables provide defaults
for the arguments if a value is not specified). Users should update
their code to use the new names. These arguments to <a href="operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm"><b>build-lisp-image</b></a> and the associated
environment variables are described in the

restrictive space considerations (rare with modern computers) should

<b>MOP function compute-default-initargs argument list changed</b>:
the MOP
function <b><a href="mop/dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs">compute-default-initargs</a></b>
has had two (undocumented) arguments not specified by the MOP: the
class-precedence-list and the direct default initargs, both calculated
by <b><a href="mop/dictionary.html#finalize-inheritance">finalize-inheritance</a></b>.
Starting in 8.2, <b><a href="mop/dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs">compute-default-initargs</a></b> accepts only one argument; the class.  In
specialized methods on <b><a href="mop/dictionary.html#compute-default-initargs">compute-default-initargs</a></b>, the other two arguments can be
re-manufactured thus:
<pre id="146">
    (let ((direct (mop:class-direct-default-initargs class))
          (cpl (slot-value class 'mop:class-precedence-list)))

<b>*default-external-format* no longer supported</b>. Actually, the
variable <a href="variables/excl/s_default-external-format_s.htm"><code>*default-external-format*</code></a> has effectively not
been supported since the introduction of locales in version 7.0 but
the documentation incorrectly said it was supported. The value
of <b><i>external-format</i></b> arguments
(to <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/open.htm"><b>open</b></a> and other
functions) which do not have specific defaults effectively defaults
to <code>(find-external-format *locale*)</code> (see

<b>Heap start locations modified for 32-bit Mac and Linux</b>. The
32-bit Linux Lisp Heap Start is changed from 0x71000000 down to
0x20000000, while the C Heap Start of the C heap on 32-bit Macs is
changed from 0x64000000 to 0x74000000. Both changes give the Lisp heap
more room to grow. You can modify the heap start locations by building
new images (see <a href="building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>. Even though
this change is in the non-backward-compatible section, it is unlikely
that any users will be adversely affected.

<b>Changes to the symbol implementation</b>. In order to better
support SMP, symbols have changed their shape and access style.
Instead of 3 AUs (Allocation Unit = 2 natural words) symbols are now 4
AUs in size. The symbol-value-vector is still accessed via the symbol
indirectly (but through a different slot), and accesses to values
through this vector are still independent per-thread, but the access
method has changed.
<p id="151">
Also, (and the primary reason for this change) the global-symbol-value
access has changed to be a direct access from within the symbol
itself.  The first fullword slot of a symbol is the value slot (it is
the second word, since the first word has a type code in it).  The
value slot now serves as the global value slot - i.e. that location
that stores the symbol's value when the symbol isn't bound by a lambda
or let form in the current thread.  Originally, the global-value cell
was the first entry in the symbol-value-vector, which might be
reallocated if it needs to grow for more threads - this would have
presented a strong challenge and a likely harsh slowdown for atomic
global-symbol-value accesses, and it would even have required accesses
to known-bound symbols to be locked.  Now, global-symbol-value reads
and writes can easily be made atomic because there is no indirection
and no possibility for the re-allocation of the object that holds the
global slot.

This change does not affect most users, but users who, for example,
reference symbols from foreign code using the specification in
the <b>misc/lisp.h</b> file will have to modify their code.

functionality. The old name can still be used but we recommend using
the new name.
</li>
<li id="156">
<b>Inspector now tracks the right margin</b>. The TTY inspector, used
except when the IDE is running, now uses the value
of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/print-ri.htm"><code>*print-right-margin*</code></a>
to decide how much data to display. See <a href="inspector.htm#right-margin-2">The inspector and the right margin</a>

<b>in-package converts symbols used for string designators to
uninterned symbols</b>. It has long been true (although not previously
documented) that the macroexpansion of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/defpacka.htm"><b>defpackage</b></a> has converted symbols used as names
to uninterned symbols. Starting in release 8.2, the macroexpansion
of <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/in-packa.htm"><b>in-package</b></a>
does this as well. See <a href="implementation.htm#cl-defpackage-2">cl:defpackage and cl:in-package</a>

the current character position of a stream and returns it, returning
<code>nil</code> if the value cannot be determined or does
not make sense.

before a class is finalized, but the class-precedence-list is
available as a slot value -- <code>(slot-value class
'mop:class-precedence-list)</code> as soon as it is calculated by
<b>mop:finalize-inheritance</b>, which might be well before the actual
finalization. See <a href="implementation.htm#class-precedence-list-2">class-precedence-list: when is it

<li id="163">
<b>SOAP notes</b>: <code>SOAPAction</code> header is now
conformant - earlier version failed to place string quotes around the

On Linux and FreeBSD, Allegro CLIM works with Open Motif 2.1 and

from <a href="http://www.openmotif.org">www.openmotif.org</a>. Allegro
CL 8.2/Allegro CLIM will work with either version. Redhat Linux 7.2 is

<b>Certain CLIM demos on Solaris 64 bit give segv or otherwise fail

environment or the Gnome 2.0 interface) on a Solaris64 machine. When
bringing up the environment, set the language/locale to "C". (On the
login screen, there's an "Options" button, which displays a menu that
has a "Languages" submenu.  Choose "C". Note: the default value is
typically "en_US".)  The "C" setting can process all of the 64-bit
font sets. However, difficulties arise when displaying over the
network. If you are displaying on the monitor of the machine running
Allegro CL (and CLIM), the demos work as long as the language/locale
is "C". They typically do not work when displaying on a monitor over
the network. As of this writing, there is no fix for the problem.

controls the behavior. The initial value of that variable is true on
the Mac and <code>nil</code> on other platforms. Setting
it to <code>nil</code> on the Mac will suppress matching
behavior. If the value is set to true on other platforms, the marks
will only be visible momentarily (specifically

<hr><h2 id="250"><a name="cg-win-gtk-2">8.6 Functionality to handle differences between Windows and GTK</a></h2>

<h3 id="251">
For complete information on the differences between Windows and GTK,
please see
<a href="cggtk-relnotes.html">cggtk-relnotes.html</a>.
</h3>


<p id="252">
Common Graphics and the IDE run on Windows and Linux with
GTK. Certain differences between the two operating systems and
windowing systems mean that some things do not work the same in
Windows as in GTK and vice versa. The functionality listed here
tries to handle the differences. Some of the
variables/operators/etc. are only available on one of the two platforms.
</p>

<h3 id="253">
Known bug with menu-items and buttons
</h3>

<p id="254">
<b>GTK Only</b>: all-black menu-items and half-black buttons.  There
is still a mystery on the GTK platform where all button widgets can
turn half black along a diagonal line, and all menu-items on some
platforms will be totally black.  This seems to happen only when
opening a project from the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a> dialog, though, so a
workaround is to not reopen a project from that dialog and instead to
use the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/recent-menu.htm">Recent menu</a>
or <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#open-project">File | Open Project</a> just afterward.  We
have tracked the problem down to the use of transparent-pane windows
such as the frame-child of a form window, but beyond that it is a
total mystery.
</p>

<h4 id="255">
Mozilla support
</h4>

<p id="256">
The system needs to know the directory where the GTK control supplied
by Mozilla to support the <a href="classes/cg/html-widget.htm"><code>html-widget</code></a> resides. (On windows, the widget is
implemented in another way.) It may not be practical to search for the
location automatically. See <a href="operators/ide/mozilla-library-path.htm"><b>mozilla-library-path</b></a>, <a href="variables/excl/s_mozilla-library-path_s.htm"><code>*mozilla-library-path*</code></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/f/find-mozilla-gtk-path.htm"><b>find-mozilla-gtk-path</b></a>.
</p>

<h4 id="257">
Event handler processes
</h4>

<p id="258">
Because Linux currently does not use native threads and Windows does,
on Windows, all windows handle events in their own thread associated
with the window while on Linux/GTK, there is one event-handling
thread. <a href="operators/cg/d/default-application-window-subkey.htm"><b>default-application-window-subkey</b></a>, <a href="variables/cg/s_use-single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*use-single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a>, and
<a href="variables/cg/s_single-cg-event-handling-process_s.htm"><code>*single-cg-event-handling-process*</code></a> allow
distinguishing behavior when necessary. <a href="operators/cg/c/cg-process-wait.htm"><b>cg-process-wait</b></a> should be used on GTK instead of
<a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a> in event
handlers. See also <a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events-if-event-handler.htm"><b>process-pending-events-if-event-handler</b></a>.
</p>



<h4 id="259">
Miscellaneous
</h4>

<ul>
<li id="260">
<b>New function override-native-shortcuts</b>. <a href="operators/cg/o/override-native-shortcuts.htm"><b>override-native-shortcuts</b></a> allows you to override
GTK shortcuts. Doing so makes menus less visually attractive but
prevents shortcuts from overriding modality of dialogs and other minor
inconveniences (see the description for all details).
</li>
<li id="261">
<b>Linux has a built-in hand cursor</b>, which is the value of <a href="variables/cg/hand-cursor.htm"><code>hand-cursor</code></a>. That variable is
<code>nil</code> on windows. <code>(find-cursor
:hand-cursor)</code> works correctly on both,
</li>
<li id="262">
<b>Linux pixel size issues</b>: because Linux/GTK seems not to have a
reliable notion of pixel size, the functions <a href="operators/cg/p/pixels-to-points.htm"><b>pixels-to-points</b></a>, <a href="operators/cg/p/points-to-pixels.htm"><b>points-to-pixels</b></a>, and <a href="operators/cg/f/font-pixel-height.htm"><b>font-pixel-height</b></a> are provided. They work on
Windows but are usually not necessary.
</li>
<li id="263">
<b>Timer resolution on Linux/GTK</b>: see <a href="variables/cg/s_cg-timer-resolution_s.htm"><code>*cg-timer-resolution*</code></a>.
</li>
<li id="264">
<b>Check marks in menus: on Linux/GTK</b>: you must specify at
creation time whether a menu-item will ever be checked. See <a href="operators/cg/c/checkable.htm"><b>checkable</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="265">
<b>Modal dialogs</b>: when displaying a modal dialog, the owner window
is usually disabled. On GTK, this may take too long. <a href="variables/cg/s_modal-dialogs-disable-owner_s.htm"><code>*modal-dialogs-disable-owner*</code></a>
handles this.
</li>
<li id="266">
<b>f10 key</b>: it requires special handling on Linux.GTK, see <a href="operators/cg/h/handle-f10.htm"><b>handle-f10</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="267">
<b>Scroll increments</b>: the new function <a href="operators/cg/s/scroll-increment.htm"><b>scroll-increment</b></a> is needed on Linux/GTK. It
works on Windows but there it is essentially the same as <a href="operators/cg/u/user-scroll.htm"><b>user-scroll</b></a> (which does not work on
Linux.GTK).
</li>
<li id="268">
<b>Using the IDE parent-window</b>: issues of mixing windows from
various applications are more complex on Linux/GTK than on
Windows. See the functions <a href="operators/ide/use-ide-parent-window.htm"><b>use-ide-parent-window</b></a>, <a href="operators/ide/maximize-ide.htm"><b>maximize-ide</b></a>, <a href="operators/ide/ide-exterior.htm"><b>ide-exterior</b></a>, and <a href="operators/ide/top-ide-window.htm"><b>top-ide-window</b></a>, and the classes <a href="classes/ide/ide-parent-window.htm"><code>ide-parent-window</code></a>, <a href="classes/ide/ide-child-window.htm"><code>ide-child-window</code></a>, and <a href="classes/ide/ide-owner-window.htm"><code>ide-owner-window</code></a>. The IDE menu item
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#maximize-ide">View |
Maximize IDE</a> (Linux/GTK only) is related.
</li>
<li id="269">

<b>On GTK, the help commands use a third-party browser rather than a dialog
within the IDE</b>.  On GTK, the IDE's help facility will no longer
use a CG html browser inside the IDE by default, due to the
unpredictability of the Mozilla GTK widget on which it is built.
Instead, <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a>
will default to <code>nil</code> so that a standalone
browser is used.  If the value of this configuration option is still
true from an earlier release, you may wish to change it to <code>nil</code>.  If <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a> is true and the CG browser
fails, the IDE will automatically turn the option off for you, though
it's possible for the IDE to be hung at that point so that you cannot
save the options file.  When <a href="operators/ide/use-cg-html-browser.htm"><b>use-cg-html-browser</b></a> is <code>nil</code>, then a standalone Firefox is invoked if <a href="operators/ide/use-private-html-browser.htm"><b>use-private-html-browser</b></a> is true, and
otherwise the URL or file path is simply placed onto the system
clipboard for the user to paste into an HTML browser program.

used by your application so its version info is about your
application. An application executable can also be modified when
copied to the application directory by specifying a value for the
<b><i>file-version-info</i></b> keyword argument
to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>.

<p id="278">
CLX (Common Lisp X) provides an interface between Common Lisp and the
X window system. All versions of Allegro CL include a compiled
version of CLX with the distribution. The <i>fasl</i>
file is <i>code/clx.fasl</i>, loaded by evaluating
<code>(require :clx)</code>. The Allegro CL products CLIM and
Allegro Composer use CLX. Users wanting low-level access to an X
server in Lisp may also want to use CLX.  CLX is not supported by
Franz Inc.
</p>
<p id="279">
The sources to CLX are supplied with the regular Allegro CL
distributions in the <i>contrib/clx/</i> directory. Note
that during installation, you are asked whether you wish to install
the <i>contrib/</i> directory and the default is not to
install it. The <i>contrib/</i> directory is not
included in the Trial distribution, but Trial users can download the
CLX sources from the Franz Inc. website as described next.
</p>
<p id="280">
The sources to CLX are also available on the Franz Inc. web site (<a href="http://www.franz.com/">www.franz.com</a>), at the location <a href="ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/clx/">ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/clx/</a>.
