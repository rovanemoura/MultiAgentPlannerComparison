<h4><a name="161"></a>Q 1.6-1) How do I install the License File into Allegro CL?</h4>

<p><strong>A 1.6-1)</strong> A new <strong>network installer</strong> for Allegro CL 7.0
Trial on Windows (8.0 Trial is not yet available) simplifies the installation procedure
significantly. One feature is the license file is retrived are installed automatically,
with no user action required beyond invoking the installer. Therefore this entry does not
apply to Allegro CL 7.0 Trial on Windows.</p>

<p>This entry does apply to all version (7.0 or 8.0) on UNIX platforms (including Linux
and Mac OS X) and to non-Trial versions on Windows (again 7.0 or 8.0). For all of those
products, the license file is retrived separately from the software and thus must be
installed as described here.</p>

<p>You should have received an email specifying a URL from which you can download your
license file. (If you haven't received that email or if you have mislaid it, see <a
href="#162">Q 1.6-2</a>. If you cannot access the URL, see <a href="#163">Q 1.6-3</a>.) 

<ol>
  <li>The email we sent you in response to your download order contains a customized URL to
    your license file. Click on that URL or copy it into a browser to retrieve your license
    file. </li>
  <li>Save the text to a file called <code>devel.lic</code>. (the name is &quot;devel&quot;
    and the type is &quot;lic&quot;.) On Linux, this is usually not a problem, but because
    Windows automates many actions and may perform them in a way you do not expect or intend,
    some users have problems getting Windows to save the file correctly. When you view this in
    the Windows Explorer, its file type must show as <code>lic</code>, not <code>txt</code> or
    <code>text</code> or anything else. Therefore, you must be careful to save this file so
    that its type is <code>lic</code> and its contents are plain text. <br>
    Each version of Windows has a slightly different method of identifying and listing file
    types. Please refer to the &quot;Windows Users&quot; section to identify how to do this on
    your individual machine. <br>
    In some instances, Windows will automatically save the file as an HTML file (<code>devel.lic.htm</code>),
    adding an HTML header and footer. <i>These headers will prevent the license file from
    working.</i> </li>
  <li>If you used the &quot;lost license&quot; URL to obtain your license file,be sure that
    you save only the license file portion of the email into <code>devel.lic</code>. If you
    save the entire email message, MIME headers and all, it will prevent the license file from
    working. </li>
  <li>Put the <code>devel.lic</code> file into the Allegro directory. </li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="162"></a>Q 2) I have misplaced the email telling me the URL from which I can
download your license?</h4>

<p><strong>A 1.6-2)</strong> <a HREF="http://lfs.franz.com:4100/lostlicense">We can send
the license to you by email.</a> (The link is to <a
HREF="http://lfs.franz.com:4100/lostlicense">http://lfs.franz.com:4100/lostlicense</a> and
on that page, you are asked for the email address you entered when you requested the
license; entering the email address and clicking the <strong>Submit</strong> button will
cause your license file(s) to be emailed to you. Please wait after clicking <strong>Submit</strong>
for the message saying the request was successful. If no license associated with the email
address is in the database, the message `No licenses found' is displayed. If that happens,
send a message to <a HREF="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a>. Be sure to
tell us the email address you used in the body of the message.)</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="163"></a><strong>Q 1.6-3) I can not access the URL for retrieving my license.
What should I do? </strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-3)</strong> Typically, this problem occurs because your system is behind
a firewall or you must use a proxy server. Our license file server rarely experiences any
significant downtime. </p>

<p>You should make sure that you should not be using a proxy server to access sites
outside of your network and that your browser is configured appropriately. If you do not
know if you should be using a proxy server, or don't know what one is, you should check
with your Network Administrator for assistance. If your system does not require a proxy
server, then perhaps you are behind a firewall that does not give access to certain ports
(see <a href="#164">Q 1.6-4</a> for an alternate location). </p>

<p>You can get your license using the lost license page (described in <a href="#162">Q
1.6-2</a>) but see <a href="#164">Q 1.6-4</a> for an alternate URL to use.</p>

<p>If the proxy server is not the problem, please email Franz Inc. at <a
HREF="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> stating that you are unable to
access the URL for retrieving your license (include the URL), and we will have the
license(s) sent to the email under which you have registered. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="164"></a><strong>Q 1.6-4) I have lost my license, but I am not able to access
http://lfs.franz.com:4100/lostlicense. Is there an alternate location? </strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-4)</strong> If you can use a browser to visit <a
href="http://www.franz.com">http://www.franz.com</a>, then you may use the alternate lost
license address: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.franz.com/lfs/lostlicense">http://www.franz.com/lfs/lostlicense</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must enter the same address that you registered under, and your current license, if
found, will be emailed to that address. The lostlicense URL cannot be used to renew an
expired or about to expire Allegro CL Trial license: as said it emails your current
license. See <a href="#165">Q 1.6-5</a> for information on renewing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, send us email at <a HREF="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a>
telling us that you cannot access either lostlicense URL and that you would like a copy of
your license sent to you.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name="165"></a>Q 1.6-5) [Trial users only] My license file is expiring: how do I to
renew and reinstall it?</h4>

<p><strong>A 1.6-5)</strong> Your Trial Edition will operate for a total of sixty days.
You may extend the license period, in 60-day increments, until some time after the next
release of Allegro CL. You update your license with the <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>
program. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="166"></a><strong>Q 1.6-6) [ACL Trial users only] I am trying to run the
newlicense program to renew my ACL trial, but I get an error: &quot;Unknown host:
lfs.franz.com&quot;. How do I keep ACL trial from expiring? </strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-6)</strong> Since the <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>
program must communicate with our License File Server in order to work, you must be online
when running <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>. Make sure that you are
connected to the internet (you can verify by trying to access <a
href="http://www.franz.com">http://www.franz.com</a> in a browser) and try again. </p>

<p>There may be a problem with your configured DNS server. Make sure these are properly
configured on your machine, asking your Network Administrator for assistance if necessary.
Your DNS server should be set up correctly if you can, for example, 

<ul>
  <li>use a browser to access <a href="http://www.franz.com">http://www.franz.com</a></li>
  <li>run <strong>ping lfs.franz.com</strong> successfully from a command/DOS prompt.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="167"></a><strong>Q 1.6-7) [ACL Trial users only] When I run newlicense to
renew my ACL trial, I get a Connection Refused error. How can I fix that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-7)</strong> This problem is most likely to occur because of your firewall
configuration. If you are able to access <a href="http://www.franz.com">http://www.franz.com</a>
via a browser, try to use the <a href="http://www.franz.com/lfs/update-trial-license">http://www.franz.com/lfs/update-trial-license</a>
page for updating as described in <a href="#165">Q 1.6-5</a> above.</p>

<p>If you continue to have problems, or <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>
reports any errors, please send us email at <a HREF="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a>
describing your problem. Please send us the contents of <em>devel.lic</em> in your
message. </p>

<hr>

<p><a name="168"></a><strong>Q 1.6-8) I still have problems with my license file. Can I
contact Franz Inc. for assistance?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-8)</strong> Yes. Questions or problems should be sent to <a
HREF="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a>. Please be sure to include the
following information: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>what happened, and what steps you took; </li>
    <li>a copy of your current license (<code><font COLOR="#ff0000">devel.lic</font></code>)
      file; </li>
    <li>a copy of any error messages that you received; and </li>
    <li>your current email address and daytime telephone number </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><a name="169"></a><strong>Q 1.6-9) I'm behind a firewall and am required to use a proxy
host to access the web. How can I update my license file with the newlicense? </strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-9)</strong> The <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>
program takes arguments for specifying a proxy host. Call it like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>newlicense -p <em>&lt;proxyhost&gt;</em> </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where <em>&lt;proxyhost&gt;</em> is the name of the proxy host you must use.</p>

<p>Note that if you are on Windows, you cannot run <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>
with the <strong>-p</strong> argument by clicking on it in the Windows explorer or by
choosing the menu item on the <strong>Start</strong> menu. You must run it from a command
line or by choosing <strong>Start | Run</strong> and typing the command (specifying the
path of <code><font COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code>) into the dialog box that is
displayed. </p>

<p><strong>Note too that the -p option only works with proxies that do not require
interaction with users</strong> (proxies that require authentication, for example, do
require such interaction). If the <strong>-p</strong> option to <code><font
COLOR="#ff0000">newlicense</font></code> does not work, try the suggestions in <a
href="#167">Q1.6-7</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="1610"></a><strong>Q 1.6-10) [Trial Users Only] When I try to run Allegro CL, a
message says my license has expired, but when I run newlicense, it says it is too early to
renew. Why might this happen?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A 1.6-10)</strong> This can happen when the date on your computer is
incorrectly set to a date in the future later than the license expiration date. Allegro CL
will not start because it thinks the license has expired. You cannot renew because the
Franz Inc. computers (which are presumably set to the correct date) determine it is not
time to renew. You can check the date on your computer by looking at the Date/Time entry
on the Control Panel. Please consult your Windows documentation for information on
resetting the date on your computer.</p>
